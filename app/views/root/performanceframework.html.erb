    <h1>Government Digital Service <strong>Performance Framework</strong></h1>
    <p>How do we know if a public service is working for users? How do we know how well it’s working? How can we tell if the changes we make are improving the service?</p>
    <p>Harnessing the power of digital tools is vital for improving the performance of public services, but it can be difficult to know where to start. This guide aims to empower service owners to design and improve transactional public services. It is based around seven principles, with easy-to-follow checklists to help you get started. We have also included a worked example for how we have approached performance management for the new <a href="http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/category/single-government-domain/">GOV.UK single government domain</a>.</p>
    <h2>Who is this framework written for?</h2>
    <p>Every government transactional service should have a single service owner accountable for its performance. The service owner will know how well the service is working for users. They will have the information at their fingertips. An empowered service owner will have more than just information. They will be iterating the design of the service frequently to learn what works and what doesn’t. They will do this on a weekly, or even daily, basis.</p>
    <p>The service owner who knows how well a service is working for users, and who is empowered to iterate the design of the service on a daily basis, will need the the right data and the right tools. Digital tools provide us with a precise and automated way to measure service performance and to generate user insight. We can use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface">APIs</a> to access and combine data from multiple sources, including digital, phone and face to face channels. We can use software to do advanced analysis and powerful data visualisations. And we can test new designs, monitoring how well they work with optimisation tools. All this means organisations can harness information to improve their ability to deliver.</p>
    <h2>What does this framework apply to?</h2>
    <p>This performance framework focuses on transactional services. In this context, a transactional service is where the user does something such as apply for a license, register a birth, pay tax or claim benefits. This is in contrast to a publishing service where the user wants to find out information about something. It also excludes ‘back office’ functions like payroll, procurement or human resources systems. A complete list of <a href="http://transactionalservices.alphagov.co.uk">government transactional services</a> is available on the Cabinet Office website.</p>
    <p>The Government has set out a <a href="http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/sites/default/files/resources/CO-2012-BP-rev.pdf">clear objective</a> on the use of performance management to help Departments drive improvements in transactional service delivery. By the end of this year, we want to establish a consistent set of cross-government metrics for digital service delivery, and publish the cost per transaction of high value services. This will enable the Government to monitor and continually improve its services.</p>
    <p>GDS has developed this framework as a first step in helping teams to achieve this goal.</p>

            In order to improve the performance of a service, you have to
            analyse and identify the information different audiences will need
            to assess that performance.</p>

             <p>There is typically a hierarchy of interested users, all of whom
             will have different metrics for success. Technical staff might have
             operational and optimisation concerns, while senior management and
             ministers will have more strategic and comparative concerns.These
             needs will be reflected in the organisation’s business

             </ol>
             <p>Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) will be few in number -
             typically around five - and are top-line indicators of how well a
             service is performing. For almost all transactional services, these
             are likely to include the volume of transactions, the cost per
             transaction and success (or conversion) rate - the proportion of
             users attempting to use a transactional service that successfully
             complete the task.</p>
             <p>There will be many other, more granular metrics that will be useful for different audiences.</p>
             <p>
              It's good practice to record every event generated by the system
              even if it’s not currently of interest. Don’t obsess over what to
              measure: measure everything (where it is cost-effective to do so).
              This maximises the flexibility to come back later and revise the
              chosen metrics and tailor data visualisations to different
              audiences. This information could come from a variety of sources,
              for example Oracle and Excel for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management">CRM</a> and finance databases, Google
              Analytics for web testing and optimisation tools, or <a href="http://www.nagios.org">Nagios</a> and
              <a href="http://www.pingdom.com">Pingdom</a> for system monitoring.

             <p>An approach that worked well for us was to run a brainstorming
             session to generate a long list of metrics which we then narrowed
             down by asking senior managers, <q>If you had to choose one KPI, what
             would it be?</q> We settled on four KPIs: user trust, task completion,
             reach and cost per successful visit.</p>

            </ol>
            <p>It is good practice to look at performance trends over time,
            rather than take a snapshot at a particular point in time. Peaks and
            dips in performance are then measured relative to this base (or
            trend) line which helps to identify the effect of communications or
            design initiatives. It also reveals seasonal variations in
            performance.</p>
            <p>Benchmarking against other services can also provide a useful
            context for judging performance. By comparing to other similar
            services (e.g. requesting a license or reporting information) you
            know whether the service is significantly better or worse than
            expected. A <a href="https://www.gov.uk/performance/transactional-services">complete list</a> of the government’s transactional services
            is available on GOV.UK.</p>
            <p>You need to know who your users are to be able to determine
            whether they are likely to need <a href="http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/2012/05/30/getting-started-on-assisted-digital/">assisted digital</a> to help them use the digital service.
            The proportion of users needing assisted digital will vary based on
            the users of the particular service. For example, a higher proportion of people
            applying for incapacity benefits are more likely to need assistance
            with digital services than those needing to pay their road tax.</p>

            <p>Combining data often reveals useful insights, for example into
            service efficiency (eg cost per transaction and <a href="#total-cost-to-serve">total cost to serve</a>)
            or proportional usage by channel (eg percentage digital uptake vs
            post, phone etc).</p>
            <p>Be aware though that combining data from different data sources can lead to huge
            storage requirements: large, data-driven organisations now talk about storage in
            terms of petabytes, the equivalent of one million gigabytes. However, there are
            cost-effective solutions to this problem already in place. For example, the
            <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/">Hadoop</a> software framework was developed to enable collection, aggregation and
            querying of such huge data stores, and is based on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce">work done by Google</a> and Yahoo

                  <p>For example graphing page load time and task completion rates together can

           <p>Communicate performance information to your users through the
           appropriate dashboards, reports and alerts. Highlight specific
           segments that you know users are interested in, and make sure that

            <h2>Checklist</h2>
            <ol class="checklist">
             <li><span class="caption">Have you done any segmentation (i.e. analysed performance data by segment)?</span></li>
             <li><span class="caption">Have you designed the appropriate dashboards, reports and alerts?</span></li>
             <li><span class="caption">Are your data visualisations visible to their intended audience?</span></li>
             <li><span class="caption">Have you followed best practice design principles for data visualisation?</span></li>
            </ol>
            <p>Typical segments include:</p>
            <ul>
             <li><b>Channel used to access service</b>: through which channel(s) did the user find out about and attempt to use the service?</li>
             <li><b>New vs. repeat visitors</b>: are first time users behaving differently to those who have used the service before?</li>
             <li><b>Geographical region</b>: how popular is the digital service by region and how does that compare with online penetration in general?</li>
             <li><b>Product type</b>: does the user experience vary depending on the type of product or service?</li>
             <li><b>Value</b>: is performance dependent on the monetary value of the product or service being sought?</li>
            </ul>
             <p><b>Dashboards</b> are objective-focused and will help inform decisions, often with the help of real-time data.</p>
             <p><b>Reports</b> provide regular, scheduled snapshots of data and tend to require extra context and time to digest.</p>
             <p><b>Alerts</b> are used to inform the users about a change or an event, often using attention-grabbing delivery mechanisms.</p>
            <p>By making your visualisations clearly visible you maximise the likelihood that the information will be acted upon - and services thereby improved.</p>
            <p>Best practices include:</p>
            <ul>
             <li><b>keeping charts plain</b>: don’t use shading, 3D or other distracting effects</li>
             <li><b>removing clutter</b>: don’t use trend lines, grid lines, unnecessary labelling</li>
             <li><b>not using pie charts</b>: they require more space and are harder to read than bar charts</li>
             <li><b>using text where a chart adds nothing</b>.</li>

            </ol>
            <p>Any service that meets user needs will include an element of user
            feedback. This should be monitored and acted upon so as to
            continually improve the service for users.</p>
            <p>A range of options are available for improving the overall performance of a
            service. The following examples are based on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing_mix">4 Ps</a> of marketing:</p>
            <ul>
             <li><b>Price</b>: can the price be changed, for example to attract people to the digital channel?</li>
             <li><b>Product</b>: can the user experience be improved (eg from user feedback, user testing, A/B testing, multivariate testing)?</li>
             <li><b>Placement</b>: can the digital service URL be placed on printed materials and voice recordings?</li>
             <li><b>Promotion</b>: can greater use of email and social media be used to promote repeated use of the digital service?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Taking an iterative approach to service development increases the
            pace of improvement and minimises the risk of failure. Don’t wait
            until the end to do this, it should happen continuously throughout
            the process.</p>

                    <p>Aside from the financial benefits, and the measurable improvements for users,
