				<h2 id="Find-popular-keywords-with-search-tools">14.1 Find popular keywords with search tools</h2>

				<p> Use search tools like <a href="http://www.semrush.com">SEMrush</a>, <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/trends/">Google Trends</a>, and <a href="https://adwords.google.com">Google Adwords</a> to find the keywords that people are searching for in external search engines like Google. What you're calling the need might not be what your users are calling it.</p>

				<p> Help GOV.UK pages appear high in search results by including these keywords in page:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>titles</li>
					<li>headings</li>
					<li>introductions / summaries</li>
					<li>chapter / part titles</li>
					<li>metadata descriptions (only for mainstream content)</li>
				</ul>

				<h2 id="find-the-most-popular-keyword">14.2 Find the most popular keyword</h2>
				<p><a href="http://www.semrush.com">SEMrush</a> will show you the terms that people are using to search for a particular subject, and how popular they are.</p>

				<h3 class="heading-level-3">Example</h3>
				<p>We’ve got a content item on GOV.UK that tells people how much holiday they can take from work. We first thought this should be called ‘annual leave’, but in the report below we found another keyword that was more popular.</p>

				<p>Register with <a href="http://www.semrush.com">SEMrush</a>, then enter ‘annual leave’ into the search field, ensuring that results are filtered to UK. </p>

        <div class="image-container">
          <%= image_tag 'content/14/keyword-research.png', :alt => "Search results for the 'annual leave' term showing 'annual leave' with a volume of 2400 & 'holiday entitlement' with a volume of 8100" %>
        </div>

				<p>Volume = searches per month</p>

				<p>The term &lsquo;holiday entitlement&rsquo; is the most popular, but ‘annual leave’ also receives a significant amount of traffic.</p>

				<h2 id="double-check-with-google-trends">14.3 Double-check with Google Trends</h2>

				<p>The volume figures aren’t exact so focus on trends and relative popularity rather than the numbers. Use multiple tools if you’re going to make a big decision, like the keywords to use in a title, based on data.</p>

				<p><a href="http://www.google.co.uk/trends/">Google Trends</a> allows you to compare alternative keywords, and shows seasonal trends.</p>

				<h3 class="heading-level-3">Example </h3>
				<p>The <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/trends/">Google Trends</a> report below confirms that &rsquo;holiday entitlement&rsquo; is more popular than &rsquo;annual leave&rsquo;.</p>

        <div class="image-container">
          <%= image_tag 'content/14/google-trends.png', :alt => "Google trends results showing results for the past 12 months within the UK" %>
        </div>

				<h2 id="optimise-content">14.4 Optimise content</h2>
				<p>Once you know the most popular keywords you can prioritise them in: </p>
				<ul>
					<li>title</li>
					<li>headings</li>
					<li>introductions / summaries</li>
					<li>chapter / part titles</li>
					<li>metadata descriptions (only for mainstream content)</li>
				</ul>

				<h3 class="heading-level-3">Example</h3>
				<p>In the page below the words &lsquo;holiday&rsquo; and &lsquo;entitlement&rsquo; are littered everywhere.</p>

				<p>You can cover more than one keyword &ndash; a lot of people also search for &lsquo;annual leave&rsquo; so we&rsquo;ve included it in the first sentence.</p>

        <div class="image-container">
          <%= image_tag 'content/14/placement-of-term-in-page.png', :alt => "" %>
        </div>

				<p>At the time of writing the page above surfaced first in Google for the search term ‘holiday entitlement’, and second for the term &lsquo;annual leave&rsquo;.</p>

        <div class="image-container">
          <%= image_tag 'content/14/google-search-results.png', :alt => "" %>
        </div>

				<h2 id="get-a-more-detailed-understanding-of-your-needs">14.5 Get a more detailed understanding of your need</h2>
        <p>As well as the keywords that people are using in search, you can also uncover the specific themes that people are searching for within a subject with <a href="https://adwords.google.com">Google Adwords.</a></p>

				<h3 class="heading-level-3">Example</h3>
				<p>Below is a <a href="https://adwords.google.com">Google Adwords</a> report that shows terms related to holiday entitlement. Click on each keyword for a drop-down list of the different variations of keyword within each theme.</p>

        <div class="image-container">
          <%= image_tag 'content/14/google-adwords.png', :alt => "Google adwords report" %>
        </div>

				<p>Make sure that you filter the results to get UK figures by clicking on the &lsquo;Local monthly searches&rsquo; heading.</p>
				<p>We’ve addressed the following themes, and used the keywords uncovered in the Adwords report in the Holiday entitlement guide:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>working</li>
					<li>maternity leave</li>
					<li>part time workers</li>
					<li>statutory</li>
					<li>minimum</li>
					<li>casual</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Information about bank holidays is covered in a separate item, so we’ve included a sign-posted links to this within content, and in the &lsquo;Other relevant links section&rsquo; at the top right-hand corner of the page.</p>

        <div class="image-container">
          <%= image_tag 'content/14/placement-in-related.png', :alt => "" %>
        </div>

				<h2 id="find-keywords-for-niche-audiences">14.6 Find keywords for niche audiences</h2>

				<p>The tools above can’t isolate niche audiences. The best way to understand what specific audience groups want is by looking at the terms that people are searching for on GOV.UK, or any other website that targets your audience.<p>

				<p>The <a href="http://goo.gl/d9PEo">Google Analytics Search Terms report</a> shows the terms that people are searching for on GOV.UK. You'll need a GOV.UK Google Analytics account to access this link, if you don't have an account request a report from your departmental single point of contact.</p>

				<p>The report below shows the different variations of the term &lsquo;holiday entitlement&lsquo; that people are searching for on GOV.UK.</p>

				<h3 class="heading-level-3">Guides / benefits / schemes</h3>

				<p>Provide a brief overview front-loading popular keywords, then list other popular keywords in the format below. You can use meta descriptions to clarify ambiguities around audience, or differentiate titles that are similar:</p>

				<p>Example: Holiday entitlement or annual leave - information for employers and workers on entitlement, calculating leave, taking leave, accruing leave and disputes.</p>

				<h3 class="heading-level-3">Quick answers</h3>
				<p>Use the first sentence if it adequately sums up the content and includes popular keywords. If it doesn’t consider changing the first sentence - it should be focussed and optimised.</p>
