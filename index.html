            The design process must start with identifying and thinking about real
            user needs. We should design around those - not around the way the
            ‘official process’ is done. We must understand those needs thoroughly
            - interrogating data, not just making assumptions - and we should
            remember that what users ask for is not always what they need.</p>

           <div class="content">
             <p>We use ‘needs’ as an organising principle since people come to our
              sites to accomplish tasks and to fulfil needs, not just to hang out.
              Focusing on needs means we can concentrate on the things that deliver
              most value for money.</p>

                  <p>This VAT page is a good example of a design that results from thinking about user needs. Most people will arrive at this page after a search for VAT rates. The answer most people are after is 20%, so we've made that the largest, clearest piece of information on the page. You can get the answer you are looking for incredibly quickly. There is more to VAT than just one rate so we've included this but clearly designed as secondary information. There's a slim chance you've arrived at the wrong page so we have links to genuinely related items in the box on the top right.</p>

           <p>The best way to build effective services is to start small and iterate
            wildly. Release Minimum Viable Products early, test them with real
            users, move from Alpha to Beta to Launch adding features and
            refinements based on feedback from real users.</p>

              failures into lessons.  And the alternative is 200 page spec documents

              digital: we’re not building bridges - things can be undone.</p>

                  <p>Once you’re happy with what some code is doing, make sure it is ‘clean’ and easy to read to aid future maintenance by yourself and others. You might also consider using this to reduce complexity and code ‘bloat’. If you’ve built something twice before, pause before doing it a third time and consider whether you can refactor avoid duplication. For instance, in your CSS, use classes rather than IDs to target commonly styled elements.</p>
