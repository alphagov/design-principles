            The design process must start with identifying and thinking about real
            user needs. We should design around those — not around the way the
            ‘official process’ is at the moment. We must understand those needs thoroughly
            — interrogating data, not just making assumptions — and we should
            remember that what users ask for is not always what they need.</p>

         <section class="why">
           <div class="content">
             <p>We use ‘needs’ as an organising principle since people come to our
              sites to accomplish tasks and to fulfil needs, not just to hang out.
              Focusing on needs means we can concentrate on the things that deliver
              most value for money.</p>

                <p>If we start from the wrong place there’s no chance we will get the design right. Before we begin any project we spend a long time working out what the user needs are. <a href="http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/2011/09/19/introducing-the-needotron-working-out-the-shape-of-the-product/">This blog post explains a bit more about how we do that.</a></p>

                  <p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/vat-rates">This VAT page</a> is a good example of a design that results from thinking about user needs. Most people will arrive at this page after a search for VAT rates. The answer most people are after is 20%, so we’ve made that the largest, clearest piece of information on the page. You can get the answer you are looking for incredibly quickly. There is more to VAT than just one rate so we’ve included this but clearly designed as secondary information. There’s a slim chance you’ve arrived at the wrong page so we have links to genuinely related items in the box on the top right.</p>
                  <p>The page is simple and clear but contains all the different information you might need.</p>

                  <p>Lots of page designs fail because the focus of the page isn’t clear. Don’t try to cram everything on to one page. By trying to do less and deciding what’s the most important thing on the page before you start designing you’ll end up with simpler, clearer designs. </p>
                  <p>Remember that government should only do what only government can do, so while it’s right we should provide information about VAT it’s not necessary for us to provide information about <a href="http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Environmentandgreenerliving/Smallholders/DG_179478">keeping bees</a>. </p>

            should do this, but we should make sure we continue this into the
            build and development process — prototyping and testing with real
            users on the live web. We should understand the desire paths of how we are designing with data and use

         <div class="outline">
           <p>The best way to build effective services is to start small and iterate
            wildly. Release <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product">Minimum Viable Products</a> early, test them with real
            users, move from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Alpha">Alpha</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Beta">Beta</a> to Launch adding features and refinements based on feedback from real users.</p>

           <div class="content">
             <p>Iteration reduces risk. It makes big failures unlikely and turns small
              failures into lessons. This avoids the 200 page spec document
              which can turn into a bottleneck. This, again, is the core advantage of
              digital: we’re not building bridges — things can be undone.</p>

                  <p>Once you’re happy with what some code is doing, make sure it is ‘clean’ and easy to read to aid future maintenance by yourself and others. You might also consider using this to reduce complexity and code ‘bloat’. If you’ve built something twice before, pause before doing it a third time and consider whether you can refactor to avoid duplication. For instance, in your CSS, use classes rather than IDs to target commonly styled elements.</p>

                  <p>The best place to include a skip to content link is towards the top of the page. This

                  <p>Skip links may be hidden from view by default, but should be brought into view when
                  the link is given keyboard focus. This approach makes the skip link available to both
                  sighted and non sighted keyboard only users, whilst keeping the visual experience

                    <p>What is a transaction?</p>
                    <p>At the end of a transaction some kind of action has been performed (above and beyond the simple exchange of information). Typically this would involve an exchange of goods and money, but government transactions also involve the transfer or creation of legal rights and obligations. Another distinguishing feature of many government transactions is that they often involve more than two parties.</p>
