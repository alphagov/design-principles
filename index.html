           <p>The design process must start with identifying and thinking about real user needs. We should design around those - not around the way the &lsquo;official process&rsquo; is done. We must understand those needs thoroughly - interrogating data not just making assumptions - and we should remember that what users ask for is not always what they&nbsp;need.</p>

           <p>Normally, we&rsquo;re not starting from scratch - users are already using our services. This means we can watch and learn from real behaviour. We should do this, but we should make sure we continue this into the build and development process - prototyping and testing with real users on the live web.

           <p>Making something look simple is easy, making something simple to use is much harder - especially when the underlying systems are complex - but that&rsquo;s what we should be&nbsp;doing.</p>

                  <p>Similarly, there should be no need for a user to understand government to interact with it. Government (especially given the maturity of the British constitution) and the services it provides are often complicated, so we should hide complexity where possible.</p>

         <div class="outline">
           <p>The best way to build effective services is to start small and iterate wildly. Release Minimum Viable Products early, test them with real users, move from Alpha to Beta to Launch adding features and refinements based on feedback from real&nbsp;users.</p>

             <p>Iteration reduces risk. It makes big failures unlikely and turns small failures into lessons.  And the alternative is 200 page spec documents which turn into bottlenecks. This again, is the core advantage of digital, we&rsquo;re not building bridges - things can be&nbsp;undone.</p>

                  <p>Once you’re happy with what some code is doing, make sure it is ‘clean’ and easy to read to aid future maintenance by yourself and others. You might also consider using this to reduce complexity and code ‘bloat’. If you’ve built something twice before, pause before doing it a third time and consider whether you can refactor avoid duplication. For instance, in your CSS, use classes rather than IDs to target commonly styled elements.</p>

         <div class="outline">
           <p>Our service doesn&rsquo;t begin and end at our website. It might start with a search engine and end at the post office. We need to design for that, even if we can&rsquo;t control it. And we need to recognise that someday, before we know it, it&rsquo;ll be about different digital services&nbsp;again.</p>

           <h2>Why?</h2>
           <div class="content">
             <p>We shouldn&rsquo;t be about websites, we should be about digital services. Right now, the best way to deliver digital services is via the web - but that might change, and sooner than we might&nbsp;expect.</p>

         <div class="outline">
           <p>Wherever possible we should use the same language and the same design patterns, this helps people get familiar with our services. But, when this isn&rsquo;t possible, we should make sure our underlying approach is consistent. So our users will have a reasonable chance of guessing what they&rsquo;re supposed to&nbsp;do.</p>

         <section class="why">
           <h2>Why?</h2>
           <div class="content">
             <p>This isn&rsquo;t a straight-jacket or a rule book. We can&rsquo;t build great services by rote. We can&rsquo;t imagine every scenario and write rules for it. Every circumstance is different and should be addressed on its own terms. What unites things, therefore, should be a consistent approach - one that users will hopefully come to understand and trust - even as we move into new digital&nbsp;spaces.</p>

         <div class="outline">
           <p>We should share what we're doing whenever we can. With colleagues, with users, with the world. Share code, share designs, share ideas, share intentions, share failures. The more eyes there are on a service the better it gets - howlers get spotted, better alternatives get pointed out, the bar gets&nbsp;raised.</p>

         <section class="why">
           <h2>Why?</h2>
           <div class="content">
             <p>Partly because much of what we&rsquo;re doing is only possible because of open source code and the generosity of the web design community. So we should pay that back. But mostly because more openness makes for better services - better understood and better scrutinised. If we give away our code, we&rsquo;ll be repaid in better code. That&rsquo;s why we're giving away all&nbsp;this&hellip;</p>
