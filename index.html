           <p>Normally, we&rsquo;re not starting from scratch - users are already using our services. This means we can watch and learn from real behaviour. We should do this, but we should make sure we continue this into the build and development process - prototyping and testing with real users on the live web. We should understand the desire paths <img class="col-1of2-5" src="/app/assets/images/content/sherlock.png" alt=" " /> and use them in our&nbsp;designs.</p>

           <p>Making something look simple is easy, making something simple to use is much harder - especially when the underlying systems are complex - but that&rsquo;s what we should be&nbsp;doing.</p>

             <p>With great power comes great responsibility - very often people have to use our services. If we don't work hard to make them simple and usable we&rsquo;re abusing that power, wasting people&rsquo;s time and lowering national&nbsp;productivity.</p>

         <div class="outline">
           <p>The best way to build effective services is to start small and iterate wildly. Release Minimum Viable Products early, test them with real users, move from Alpha to Beta to Launch adding features and refinements based on feedback from real&nbsp;users. <img class="col-1of2-5" src="/app/assets/images/content/iterate_iterate.png" alt="" /></p>

             <p>Iteration reduces risk. It makes big failures unlikely and turns small failures into lessons.  And the alternative is 200 page spec documents which turn into bottlenecks. This again, is the core advantage of digital, we&rsquo;re not building bridges - things can be&nbsp;undone.</p>

           <p>Steve Balmer said it - &ldquo;Accessible design is good design&rdquo;. We should build a product that&rsquo;s as inclusive, legible and readable as possible. If we have to sacrifice elegance - so be it. We shouldn&rsquo;t be afraid of the obvious, shouldn&rsquo;t try to reinvent web design conventions and should set expectations&nbsp;clearly.</p>

           <p>Wherever possible we should use the same language and the same design patterns, this helps people get familiar with our services.

             <p>Partly because much of what we&rsquo;re doing is only possible because of open source code and the generosity of the web design community. So we should pay that back. But mostly because more openness makes for better services - better understood and better scrutinised. If we give away our code, we&rsquo;ll be repaid in better code.
