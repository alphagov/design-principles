  <p>Welcome to the Government Service Design Manual. From April this will be the place to find the digital by default service standard, as well as guidance and tools for building world-class digital services.</p>

  <p>This is an experimental beta version of the manual, and it may contain inaccuracies or have gaps.</p>

  <p>We will be working to improve the site before a full release in April. If you have any feedback please email <a href="mailto:dbdss@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk">dbdss@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk</a></p>

    <div class="inner">
      <p>At different points in your project you’ll have to choose one technology over others. That might be a programming language, database, operating system or some small tool that helps the development team work more efficiently.</p>

<h2 id="you-can-change-your-mind">You can change your mind</h2>

<p>The most important consideration is to work on the assumption that most technology choices can change, especially during the early stages of development. </p>

<p>On day one of your project you simply won’t know enough about the domain or the user need to select the <em>right</em> technology. It’s OK to make an educated guess at this stage, as long as everyone understands that is what is happening. Then find time to challenge the selection as you learn more about the problem at hand.</p>

<p>Maybe you selected a programming language that you knew would be easier and quicker to prototype in for the early stages of the project, and then moved to another one that was easier to work in large teams with for the final product. Or maybe you started out with an open source product to allow you to get started quickly, before going on to buy a commercial product which provided some required feature.</p>

<h2 id="start-with-capabilities-not-implementations">Start with capabilities, not implementations</h2>

<p>It’s very easy to immediately jump to a specific product when making technology choices. This tends to be based either on past experience or on fashion. </p>

<p>Try and take a step back and think about the capabilities of the technology you’re after. Are you looking for a relational database? Or a document database? A key/value store? Or maybe a graph database? Argue first about the capabilities, rather than any specific implementation.</p>

<h2 id="cost">Cost</h2>

<p>With the growth of open source many technology products (databases, operating systems, programming languages, development tools, etc.) are freely available. But a large market still exists for commercial software products. </p>

<p>When choosing technology make sure you do consider the total cost, as well as any upfront fees. Try and take into consideration costs for things like staff, support and productivity.</p>

<h2 id="consider-people">Consider people</h2>

<p>Try and involve the whole team in technology choices. That doesn’t mean no-one owns the decision making but that you want the development team to buy in to the technology choices made. Technology preferences vary, and technology choice can divide opinion. </p>

<p>All things being equal, picking technologies that developers and operations staff like will likely result in improved productivity.</p>

<h2 id="lock-in">Lock-in</h2>

<p>Technology lock-in happens when previous decisions regarding technology limit future decisions, possibly so that only one real choice exists.</p>

<p>For example, if you select a database that only runs on one operating system you have no choice about the operating system you will use. If the costs of that operating system jump you have no simple way of reducing that cost quickly or cheaply.</p>

<p>Over time, and after many decisions, you can find yourself in a situation where all your technology decisions are tightly coupled and you are locked-in to one vendor or one way of doing things. This can have unforseen financial costs (for example an overnight cost increase) but can also limit how quickly you can iterate on your product in the future, for instance if the ideal technology choice isn’t compatible with your current vendor or technology.</p>

<h2 id="why-we-do-this">Why we do this</h2>

<p>Choosing technology is important, but it’s probably not quite as important as you think. What is important are the users of that technology and being able to deliver quality at a sustainable pace and suitable cost. When making technology choices, and importantly as you develop your product and constantly reassess your selections, try and make decisions that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>maximise developer productivity</li>
  <li>minimise total cost of ownership</li>
  <li>avoid lock-in</li>
</ul>
