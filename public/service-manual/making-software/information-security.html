      <p>When building your service, you will need to ensure that appropriate steps are
taken to ensure its security. Information security is a topic both broad and
deep, drawing from fields ranging from economics and psychology through to
mathematics and probability, and this document cannot claim to provide a
thorough review of the field. Instead, it aims to provide you with the briefest
of introductions to information security, and will explain the communities and
processes that exist to help you build world class secure services.</p>

<h2 id="introduction-to-information-security">Introduction to information security</h2>

<p>The term information security refers to the theory and practice of defending
data or information systems against unauthorized or unintended access,
destruction, disruption or tampering. Security professionals frequently refer to
three key concepts:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Confidentiality</dt>
  <dd>the assurance that information is not disclosed to individuals or systems that
are not authorized to receive it.</dd>
  <dt>Integrity</dt>
  <dd>the assurance that information can not be modified by those who are not
authorized to modify it, or that any such modifications will not pass
undetected.</dd>
  <dt>Availability</dt>
  <dd>the assurance that information is available when it is needed, specifically
that mishap or malice cannot affect the ability of systems to provide the
information when requested.</dd>
</dl>

<p>In government, much is made of these three “key concepts of information
security,” as will be explained below. Security systems typically attempt to
address one or more of these concerns through:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Physical controls: walls, locked doors, guards</li>
  <li>Procedural controls: managerial oversight, staff training, defined emergency
response processes</li>
  <li>Regulatory controls: legislation, policy, rules of conduct</li>
  <li>Technical controls: cryptographic software, authentication and authorization
systems, secure protocols</li>
</ul>

<p>Not every system requires a full battery of security controls. Indeed,
‘completely secure systems’ do not exist, and overly secure systems are often
prohibitively expensive or thoroughly inconvenient for their users. You should
aim to build services that are <em>appropriately secure</em>, and in practice you will
be guided by an assessment of the risks associated with a lapse in
the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of your service.</p>

<h2 id="information-security-in-government">Information security in government</h2>

<p>Within government, there is an established set of assurance and accreditation
processes. These provide a structure and a shared language within which to
discuss, analyse and address security considerations. If the processes work
correctly, managers should have a clear and accurate understanding of what risks
they are accepting, and those delivering the service should know what controls
they are going to employ to mitigate those risks.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Assurance</strong> is the broad set of activities involved in assessing and
managing the risks associated with the system under development, while
<strong>accreditation</strong> refers to a subset of the assurance work, involving a formal
and independently verified process similar to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_27001">ISO27001</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The important thing to note about building trustworthy and secure systems is
that it is a team game. Assurance and accreditation should not be a completely
separate strand of work, or be seen as a hurdle to be jumped over (or
sidestepped). Only by engaging with risk and making decisions based on a range
of expert opinion will you end up with the best product.</p>

<p>The rest of this document will introduce you to assurance and accreditation in
government. The content will use quite a lot of acronyms; unfortunately these
are in common usage and it’s very hard to engage with the existing documentation
and processes without speaking the lingo. We include them here in the hope that
they will provide a helpful reference which can be used when reading existing
documentation.</p>

<h2 id="roles">Roles</h2>

<p>It’s important to understand the different roles involved within the process
detailed below. One of the first things you should do on your project is to
establish who plays each of these roles. Note that all of them require formal
training and specialist skills.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Senior Information Risk Owner (<abbr title="Senior Information Risk Officer">SIRO</abbr>)</dt>
  <dd>Generally a senior member of the lead organisation providing the service.
Ultimately responsible for the risk profile of the service, it is the <abbr title="Senior Information Risk Officer">SIRO</abbr>’s
job to know whether all the risks been identified, whether there appropriate
mitigations in place so that the risks can be accepted, and so on.</dd>
  <dt>Accreditor</dt>
  <dd>More hands on than the <abbr title="Senior Information Risk Officer">SIRO</abbr>, the accreditor or accreditors will work with the
project team to help with understanding the process, identify risks and
suggest mitigations.</dd>
  <dt><abbr title="UK National Technical Authority for information assurance">CESG</abbr> Listed Adviser Scheme (<abbr title="CESG Listed Adviser Scheme">CLAS</abbr>) Consultant</dt>
  <dd>Part of the formal accreditation process. Responsible for much of the formal
documentation.</dd>
  <dt><abbr title="UK National Technical Authority for information assurance">CESG</abbr> (originally Communications-Electronics Security Group)</dt>
  <dd><a href="http://www.cesg.gov.uk/Pages/homepage.aspx"><abbr title="UK National Technical Authority for information assurance">CESG</abbr></a> are the government agency
responsible for Information Security. They can provide technical assistance or
consultation on project issues.</dd>
</dl>

<p>All projects, however small, should involve some level of assurance. This may be
as simple as documenting the limited risks and proposing to the <abbr title="Senior Information Risk Officer">SIRO</abbr> that the
project does not require a formal accreditation. For anything involving
sensitive data or of interest to lots of people an accreditation stage will be
required, and this process is likely to include representatives from all of the
above groups.</p>

<h2 id="business-impact-levels">Business Impact Levels</h2>

<p>Business Impact Levels, often shorted to Impact Levels (<abbr title="Impact Level">IL</abbr>) are a set of numbers used to guide discussions of risk in Government projects. Specifically they are numbers between 0 and 6 for each of the three key concepts mentioned above, and measure:</p>

<ul>
  <li>For confidentiality: the potential impact if the information is seen by those who should not see it</li>
  <li>For integrity: the potential impact if the accuracy or completeness of the information is compromised</li>
  <li>For availability: the potential impact if the information becomes inaccessible</li>
</ul>

<p>More details about identifying these numbers can be found in this <a href="http://www.cesg.gov.uk/publications/Documents/business_impact_tables.pdf">extract from HMG <abbr title="information assurance">IA</abbr> Standard No. 1</a>.</p>

<h2 id="agile-design">Agile Design</h2>

<p>The role-holders listed above will work with the wider team to bring the appropriate concerns to bear in the process of designing the service. The team as a whole will need to make a range of decisions about topics such as what information needs to be captured, how it is processed, whether it is stored, and so on which will have a direct impact on the assurance/accreditation process.</p>

<p>A close working relationship will be essential to ensure that business impact levels and other details are kept up to date as designs evolve and that risk management plays an appropriate role as a constraint in the design process.</p>

<h2 id="good-practice-guides-gpg">Good Practice Guides (<abbr title="Good Practice Guide">GPG</abbr>)</h2>

<p>The Good Practice Guides (<abbr title="Good Practice Guide">GPG</abbr>) are documents published by <abbr title="UK National Technical Authority for information assurance">CESG</abbr> on specific topics of interest to various types of projects. These can act as a good starting point when looking to identify risks and put in place mitigations.</p>

<p>Unfortunately many of these documents are Restricted. It is advisable to establish a working relationship with <abbr title="UK National Technical Authority for information assurance">CESG</abbr> early on in the project to make sure you can access these documents. Examples include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>GPG13 – Protective monitoring</li>
  <li>GPG8 – Protecting External Connections to the Internet</li>
  <li>GPG12 – Use of Virtualisation Products for Data Separation</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="risk-management-document-set-rmads">Risk Management Document Set (<abbr title="Risk Management Document Set">RMADS</abbr>)</h2>

<p>The Risk Management Document Set or <abbr title="Risk Management Document Set">RMADS</abbr> are the result of the formal accreditation work. This is likely a large set of documents, including the Baseline Control Set (<abbr title="Baseline Control Set">BCS</abbr>), system overview and supporting evidence, presented to the <abbr title="Senior Information Risk Officer">SIRO</abbr> for sign-off as part of go-live conversations.</p>

<h2 id="it-health-check-ithc">IT Health Check (<abbr title="IT Health Check">ITHC</abbr>)</h2>

<p>The IT Health Check (<abbr title="IT Health Check">ITHC</abbr>) forms part of the formal Accreditation. In essence it is a penetration test carried out by a <abbr title="UK National Technical Authority for information assurance">CESG</abbr> approved supplier (specifically a <abbr title="A CESG scheme to accredit 3rd party penetration testers">CHECK</abbr> certified individual). Read the guide about <a href="/service-manual/operations/penetration-testing.html">penetration and vulnerability testing</a> for more details.</p>

<h2 id="ongoing">Ongoing</h2>

<p>The assurance and accreditation work described above is not just about getting a project to launch. It also covers the running of the resulting service. Over time, new threats may emerge, systems and processes may change, and assumptions may become invalid.</p>

<p>Documentation should be kept up-to-date and additional penetration tests organised on a regular or as-needed basis.</p>

<h2 id="tools">Tools</h2>

<p>It is important to start understanding risks and engaging with the assurance and accreditation process as early in a project as possible. The following is a good starting place for milestones to add to a project plan:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Identify the <abbr title="Senior Information Risk Officer">SIRO</abbr></li>
  <li>Work with an accreditor to identify the Business Impact Levels</li>
  <li>Confirm with the <abbr title="Senior Information Risk Officer">SIRO</abbr> the target Business Impact Levels</li>
  <li>Confirm with the <abbr title="Senior Information Risk Officer">SIRO</abbr> whether a formal Accreditation is required</li>
  <li>Procure a <abbr title="CESG Listed Adviser Scheme">CLAS</abbr> consultant if needed for the Accreditation work</li>
  <li>If possible establish a contact at <abbr title="UK National Technical Authority for information assurance">CESG</abbr> who can offer assistance and some technical oversight</li>
  <li>Produce supporting documentation; for example architecture documentation, risks and mitigations, operating processes, references to <abbr title="Good Practice Guides">GPGs</abbr>, controls</li>
  <li>Work with the <abbr title="CESG Listed Adviser Scheme">CLAS</abbr> consultant on completing the <abbr title="Risk Management Document Set">RMADS</abbr> is required</li>
  <li>Arrange the <abbr title="IT Health Check">ITHC</abbr></li>
  <li>Present to the <abbr title="Senior Information Risk Officer">SIRO</abbr> to get final sign-off</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="risk-management">Risk management</h2>

<p>It’s important to understand the assurance and accreditation processes and tools are all about managing the risk associated with the running service. Security is part of this, but just one part.</p>

<p>Nearly everything brings with it risks: technology choice, staffing, processes, access to restricted documents, data aggregation, etc. It is important to understand those risks and put in place sensible and suitable mitigations. It is unrealistic in most cases to aim for a system with no risks, and ignoring them is a recipe for future exploits.</p>

<p>The aim is a system where the risks are known and the team, working with risk professionals, have made careful decisions about how to deal with them.</p>
