    <div class="inner">
      <p>The completion rate measures the proportion of people who start a transaction and are able to complete it.</p>

<p>A transaction is a self-contained process that the service manager has defined in relation to the service. Typically this will be completing an entire transaction from end to end but where a transaction can be completed only partly online, it may be completing a discrete process within the transaction: booking an appointment or completing a part of an application, for example.</p>

<h2 id="why-measure-completion-rate">Why measure completion rate?</h2>

<p>When users are unable to complete a digital transaction it can lead to avoidable contact through other channels. This in turn leads to low levels of digital take-up and customer satisfaction, and a higher cost per transaction.</p>

<p>Measuring end-to-end completion rates helps identify whether users have problems completing a transaction; subsequent analysis of drop-out rates at each step of a transaction can then pinpoint the specific processes that users fail to complete.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-measure-completion-rate">How to measure completion rate</h2>

<p>The end-to-end completion rate can be calculated as the number of completed transactions divided by the number of started transactions; it is expressed as a percentage. </p>

<h3 id="before-the-transaction-starts">Before the transaction starts</h3>

<p>Users should be told clearly what the outcome of the transaction will be, who can use it, how long it is likely to take, and what they will need to complete it (eg a reference number or credit card) before the transaction has started.  They will also need to be provided with the eligibility criteria and the costs to complete the transaction. This will help to reduce dropouts later in the transaction.</p>

<p>Typically this information will be given on a single page. In some cases, there may be a set of pages that checks a user’s eligibility based on information they provide.</p>

<p>It should not be possible to bypass start pages via links or search engine results. Users who try to access another transaction page directly should be referred back to the start page, unless they are resuming a previously saved transaction.</p>

<h3 id="start-and-end-points">Start and end points</h3>

<p>Transactions will begin and end on GOV.UK to allow GDS to monitor completion rates. </p>

<p>A transaction is considered to have started only when the user proceeds from the start page. A user then has to reach the end page before the transaction is counted as complete. </p>

<p>Data on the number of started and completed transactions will be shared with service owners.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/measuring-completion-rates.png" alt="Completion rate" /></p>

<h3 id="drop-outs">Drop-outs</h3>

<p>Service managers will be responsible for measuring and monitoring drop-out rates within transactions which are not hosted on GOV.UK. You should analyse this data and use it to improve your service.</p>

<p>You should build your service with unique URLs for each step / page. This will make your service much easier to measure.</p>

<h3 id="saving-or-resuming-progress-during-a-transaction">Saving or resuming progress during a transaction</h3>

<p>Some services allow users to save a transaction mid flow and to resume it another time.</p>

<p>Ideally it should be possible to match saved transactions with resumed transactions so that, for the purposes of completion rate, they are treated as one continuous process.</p>

<p>Service managers could consider applying a nominal time limit to saved transactions after which, if they haven’t been resumed, they are classed as failed. Alternatively, saved transactions could be set to expire after a given length of time.                          </p>

<h3 id="multiple-endpoints">Multiple endpoints</h3>

<p>Some services have complex flows and there may be several points at which a transaction can be successfully completed. These will need to be defined by service managers and should point to appropriate end pages on GOV.UK so they count towards the completed transaction total.</p>

<h3 id="offline-fulfilment">Offline fulfilment</h3>

<p>Some transactional services have parts which are digital and others which are non-digital. For example, when granting a lasting power of attorney, users can start and finish the transaction online, but are required to print, sign and post a form in the middle of the process. </p>

<p>In these situations the second online part of the transaction should be treated as a resumption of the first part. Where it is not possible to match the two, the discrete digital parts of the service should be treated as separate tasks, with the measure completion rate measured for each. </p>

<p>Offline parts of the process can still be measured but this is likely to be done through qualitative feedback (e.g from surveys, diary studies, focus groups).</p>

<h2 id="when-to-measure-completion-rate">When to measure completion rate</h2>

<p>In order to successfully measure your service completion rate we recommend follow the guidance below:</p>

<h3 id="guidancetool">Guidance/Tool</h3>

<p>Discovery</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ensure all transaction pages have unique URLs</li>
  <li>Develop a plan to measure completion rate throughout product development</li>
  <li>Assess the available analytics tools</li>
</ul>

<p>Alpha</p>

<ul>
  <li>Benchmark task completion rate via usability testing and establish reasons for failed transactions</li>
  <li>Procure digital analytics tool</li>
</ul>

<p>Beta</p>

<ul>
  <li>Conduct another round of usability testing to ensure that task completion rates improve</li>
</ul>

<p>Live</p>

<ul>
  <li>Analyse task completion rate to continually improve the service</li>
  <li>Carry out further usability testing to continually identify any usability problems and feed into service design</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how-frequently-should-i-measure-task-completion-rate">How frequently should I measure task completion rate?</h3>

<p>Completion rate should be measured continuously. Once the service is live this will be done on GOV.UK.</p>

<h3 id="how-can-i-test-the-completion-rate-before-launch">How can I test the completion rate before launch?</h3>

<p>Before launch completion rates can be measured with usability testing. This should be iteratively tested with at least five people. </p>

<p>This should identify <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/why-you-only-need-to-test-with-5-users/">over 85%</a> of usability problems. Users will be given a pre-determined set of tasks that reflect what needs to be done to use the service. These tasks will include all aspects of using the service that apply, such as registering, applying, submitting, verifying, amending and unsubscribing. If users are having difficulty completing tasks, further development should be followed by further rounds of testing.</p>

<h3 id="what-about-post-launch">What about post launch?</h3>

<p>Digital analytics will be the primary method for measuring task completion rates post launch. Please note that this relies on extra configuration in the analytics tool. It will not be available by default.</p>

<p>The focus of the service team’s activities will be to continually improve this by monitoring where users are dropping out of the transaction process and testing out new designs for those pages. End to end completion rates will be piped automatically from GOV.UK’s digital analytics into the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/performance">Performance Platform</a> and will be publicly available from the point of launch.</p>

<p>Further usability should also be carried out once a service have gone live to measure use of the service and identify any issues and improvements that can be made. </p>
