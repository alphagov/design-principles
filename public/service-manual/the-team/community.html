      <h2 id="context--background">Context &amp; background</h2>

<p>Communities have needs at every stage of their development, and generally require some element of management and support, however light-touch, in order to thrive.</p>

<p>This framework has been developed within the Government Digital Service (GDS) People and Skills Team, following research and consultation with communities related to and outside GDS, and drawing on extensive experience of community development and management outside the public sector. </p>

<p>It is intended to provide community owners and members with a common vocabulary and set of approaches, aimed at helping communities to function more effectively and efficiently, as well as providing support to enable ongoing development and capability-building.</p>

<p>The community framework aims to provide a lightweight structure for those involved in establishing or managing communities of practice within government contexts. It is not an exhaustive how-to guide for community management.</p>

<h2 id="community-typology">Community typology</h2>

<p>There are many different types of community.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Communities of interest link people with a shared passion or curiosity about a particular topic (e.g. people interested in architecture or who like ska music)</li>
  <li>Communities of circumstance contain people who share a common situation, which could be life stage related, or otherwise (e.g. people who are expecting a baby or those who have a particular medical condition)</li>
  <li>Communities of purpose consist of people working towards a common goal or taking group action (e.g. a protest group or people learning a skill together)</li>
  <li>Communities of place consist of people who share a common location, whether local (e.g. a building or department) or bigger (e.g. a region or country)</li>
  <li>Communities of practice consist of individuals who share common job roles and/or functional responsibilities or remit. </li>
</ul>

<p>Above all, it’s important to understand that having things in common isn’t enough to make a community. The key is regular interaction around a common, mutually-interesting context.</p>

<p>Each type of community comes with its own challenges and potential solutions, though they can often be supported using similar approaches.</p>

<h2 id="communities-of-practice">Communities of Practice</h2>

<p>This community framework is intended to help those who are developing a community of practice within government.</p>

<ul>
  <li>They may be collocated or distributed</li>
  <li>They may have the same job title or be called different things</li>
  <li>They may be well-connected or not know each other exist</li>
  <li>They may have had the same training, or found their way into the role by other routes</li>
  <li>They may be the only one of their community in their department, or one of several</li>
  <li>The communities may be active (that is, identified and organised) or latent. </li>
</ul>

<p>Most importantly, those involved in a community of practice will have common goals, tasks, challenges and solutions, and may therefore benefit from or be able to contribute to shared knowledge, ongoing learning, resources and support.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this project, we are predominantly interested in communities of digital practice, ie people working in government in similar digital roles, or with a goal to deliver similar digital products/services.</p>

<p>There is a growing awareness that with the growth (in number and scale) of communities of practice within government brings opportunities as well as challenges for those involved. </p>

<h2 id="what-do-communities-need">What do communities need?</h2>

<p>Communities need development and support in three areas in order to thrive: </p>

<h3 id="people">People</h3>
<p>Anything to do with who is involved with or responsible for the community. 
It might be helpful to consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>who belongs to the community</li>
  <li>how someone might join or find themselves involved in the community, eg is membership automatic?</li>
  <li>how members might know who else is involved in the community</li>
  <li>whether there different roles and responsibilities for members </li>
  <li>who is responsible for the community’s development and success, which might include having community monitoring or management as part of their job description, or objectives</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="programme">Programme</h3>
<p>Covers how the community operates day-to-day, including events, objectives and overall direction of travel.
Worth pondering:</p>

<ul>
  <li>what the community is doing as a group</li>
  <li>how often they are interacting, either in large or small groups, on or offline </li>
  <li>who creates the schedule for events</li>
  <li>How are successes and challenges shared?
• Are there common goals?</li>
  <li>Which activities are predictable and plannable?</li>
  <li>Can members get involved with organising/running events and community activities?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="platform">Platform</h3>
<p>Covers the place(s) that community interaction and activity happens. These may be on or offline.
Think about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Where does interaction take place? </li>
  <li>Is there a commonly owned space? </li>
  <li>Where is knowledge and information shared? </li>
  <li>Is there a central repository of contact details?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="checklist">Checklist</h2>
<p>This checklist has been developed to encourage community owners to think holistically about community development. You should be able to answer ‘yes’ to each of the questions, though how each is being fulfilled may vary widely from one community to another.</p>

<p>The ten questions relate to the three areas outlined above. By working through and answering the questions, you should be able to gain a good understanding of which areas need focus or attention.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Is there a clearly-defined border? i.e. can people easily understand the criteria for membership?</li>
  <li>Is there a way for community members to identify each other and find contact details?</li>
  <li>Is there at least one person responsible for curating information and encouraging constructive participation?</li>
  <li>Is there a way for members to interact in a transient or informal way?</li>
  <li>Is there a way or place for people to share or archive potentially useful resources, knowledge and documents?</li>
  <li>Are there regular opportunities for community members to meet in person?</li>
  <li>Is there a published and community-owned programme of activity, both on- and offline?</li>
  <li>Are there opportunities for members to influence the activities and resources of the community?</li>
  <li>Is there a clear, circulated community vision or objective?</li>
  <li>Are there clearly-defined metrics and plans to measure and regularly report on community activity?</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="principles">Principles</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Everyone has something to contribute (even the smallest voice/newest member). </li>
  <li>Respect each others’ perspectives and experiences, and respect things shared in confidence within community environments.</li>
  <li>If in doubt, share it: ideas, questions, solutions. Publish don’t send. Build community knowledge whenever you can.</li>
  <li>Beware absolutist positions. Experiences vary widely across government and to some extent everyone is making it up as they go along. This is how trails get blazed. What’s important is how we recognise and share learnings</li>
  <li>Remember you are part of a bigger network. Use it. Work as a community as well as a cohort. You will learn more from each other than you do from gds</li>
  <li>Community members will influence and lead the way service management emerges as a discipline within government. Be prepared to share your learnings and experience, and contribute to community development planning.</li>
</ul>
