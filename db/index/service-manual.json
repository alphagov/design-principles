Continuous delivery is about producing regular iterations of your software that’s ready to be released (deployed), though you don’t have to release these iterations to the public. Producing regular iterations makes it easier for you to: If your software isn’t ready to be used then it’s not creating any real value. Treat it as stock piling up - and stock is waste. From the Lean philosophy Test all iterations of your software, either through public user testing or automated testing (using separate software to perform the testing). Automate your deployment process. Doing so means you are forced to fully understand it, and any issues with moving code from your version control system into production (when it’s gone live) can be dealt with early on. Automating it early also means that code will be tested and any bugs fixed so that releases become frequent, low-risk, almost boring events. Don’t plan production release slots far in advance. You can’t be certain what will be ready in 6 months time. Make your release planning simpler - make sure it’s flexible enough that any feature or update to your software can be deployed when it’s ready. Then, if a feature needs to miss a release slot, it can easily be rescheduled for tomorrow or next week, rather than in 6 months, or more if the next slot is already full. Another advantage is being able to quickly respond to security patches or similar changes in underlying  libraries or frameworks used by your application. You can quickly make a change and watch the update flow through the various gates in your deployment pipeline, confident that nothing has been broken. What happens to code between it being written by a developer and deployed to production is known as the deployment pipeline. Understand your end-to-end deployment pipeline. Knowing how it works and how each element works together will have implications for: The deployment pipeline has 4 stages: When your developer checks into version control (where all code, including previous versions, are stored), a range of tests should be run against the latest version of the code. Any quick, easy-to-identify defects, like compile errors or unit test failures, will be found at this stage. If the tests pass, the code progresses to the next stage and should be considered for release into production. Send the code to a shared sandbox (testing) environment. This is the first environment where the application is deployed and run and the first stage where it can be visually inspected for quality by anybody on the team. Make the sandbox environment as similar to the production (live) version as far as is practical: eg, if production uses Postgres, the sandbox should also use Postgres and not another database like MySQL or sqlite. The purpose is to find any defects in the code. If a defect is found, stop the version of the code at this stage. If it passes the sandbox environment it can move on to further specialist testing environments. You may need to perform additional testing for specialist requirements, like load and performance testing, penetration testing, or accessibility testing. The amount of environments you’ll need will depend on the requirements and conditions of your individual projects. When you are satisfied with the quality of the code move it to the live production environment. Your code is ready to go live if it has: Deploy to production the same way as you deploy to any other environment – use the same scripts, same configuration management tooling, and the same version of the code.  This means you’re not releasing code for the first time – you’re performing a task that’s been validated at each stage throughout the deployment pipeline.","description":"Continuous delivery is about producing regular iterations of your software that’s ready to be released (deployed), though you don’t have to release these iterations to the public.","link":"/service-manual/agile/continuous-delivery.html"},{"title":"Features of agile","indexable_content":"Sprints Standard meetings Daily Stand Up Sprint planning Sprint Review Retrospectives User stories Testing in Agile the length of the project – use shorter sprints for shorter projects, giving you greater visibility of what’s going on, the opportunity to iterate and the flexibility to adaptively plan team members that are new to the Scrum process:     shorter sprints means those that are new to Scrum get used to the regular meeting formats and processes faster      shorter sprints means those that are new to Scrum get used to the regular meeting formats and processes faster how often you release code to production  - if it’s only released at the end of each sprint decide how often do you want to ship production-ready code get the development and working environments set up agree some of the design principles (technical, product, interaction, content) prepare the product backlog for the first sprint daily stand-ups sprint planning sprint reviews retrospectives what I worked on/produced yesterday what I am working on today (and help I might need) what’s blocking me (ie stopping me from finishing a user story card) understand the story and acceptance criteria agree on the number of user stories they’ll aim to achieve within each sprint agree on the tasks needed to complete it what we will do? how we will do it? Some common features of the agile development methods we’ve used at GDS. Sprints are part of an agile process that uses Scrum, a framework for teams developing a product. Sprints are about planning what you and your team will achieve and when you will achieve it by. Each member of your team should have a task to complete within each sprint. Each sprint is of equal length and usually lasts between 1 to 2 weeks, but you can use longer or shorter sprints in your project. When deciding the length of your sprints, consider: Start the process with a sprint 0. This sprint is about preparing your team for the first sprint. Use a sprint 0 to: While there are other agile methodologies that don’t rely on sprinting, such as Kanban, it’s common for teams to start with scrum and sprint. Agile processes have 4 different types of regular meetings: Have daily meetings with your team lasting no more than 15 minutes. It’s best if you do it standing up, in a semicircle, in front of your project wall. This will help you to keep it short and allows your team members to point at user story cards on the wall to keep things on topic. Each member of your team should answer: To stop your meetings from becoming repetitive, have an object that you (gently) throw to someone to signify they should speak next. Pick people at random - it keeps people on their toes and lets the person speaking to choose the person they wish to hear from next. At GDS we use cuddly toys or a piece of fruit. It’s a bit of fun. You don’t have to this - it’s just something to experiment with. Ask people to keep it brief and don’t be afraid to remind them of this. If people try to solve issues during the stand-up, stop the conversation and arrange a huddle after the stand-up to discuss in a smaller group. Sprint planning is done at the start of each sprint. It requires user stories to have been written in advance with acceptance criteria. The Product Owner should read out the stories and explain the acceptance criteria in order of priority. It’s the job of the team to: A good description of sprint planning is on the Agile Learning Labs website, explaining its 2 parts: This meeting can be hard to get right with large teams. Some people want to dig deep and question every story; others want to keep moving and don’t want to go into detail. Persevere! it’s an important part of the sprint and like Marmite, love or hate it, it’s good for you. This is a chance for team members to demonstrate the work they’ve produced during the sprint.

Quality is the responsibility of every member of your team – the people who create the service create the quality of it. Every person on your project should be part of increasing quality and fixing issues. Quality will mean different things to different members of the team. Fundamentally it is about the end-to-end experience of the service’s users, from the start to the end of the transaction, which may include: ‘Technical debt’ is a common term in software development, and definitions vary. Generally, technical debt is a term used to describe compromises made in the development of a product, just so it can be finished quickly - instead of creating a clean, expandable technical design. These compromises mean there’s still work to be done, even though the overall product is finished. It’s impossible to develop your software without building up some technical debt, so make sure your team have some way of sharing an understanding of the technical debt in their system. A large amount of technical debt will slow down future development.  Know how much of it you have and you can prioritise work to reduce it, and can continue to iterate rapidly in the future. You won’t know how great your product is or if it meets your criteria without testing it – in both normal and unusual conditions. Dylan Robert’s book “Learning From First Responders” is worth reviewing as an example of testing software and teams under unusual stresses (in this case, the final stages of a Presidential campaign). The following sections of this manual give further information on testing: The quality of any digital service is the responsibility of the entire team, but the final responsibility lies with the Service Manager. Make sure your Service Manager works with the rest of your team. Otherwise you risk your team not understanding what measures they need to put in place to guarantee quality.

Agile Retrospectives: Making Good Teams Great. A central principle of agile is quick feedback loops – you demonstrate something to the user as soon as possible so you can see how well it suits their needs. Retrospectives are the way we apply this to our own teams to find out what’s working and what isn’t, so a team can continuously improve.  A retrospective is a meeting at the end of a sprint where your team get a chance to talk about what went well and badly in that sprint, and take some actions to improve matters. It can also cover a larger scope, eg a full project retrospective. A retrospective takes the following form: This is a chance for everyone in your team to contribute to improving process/productivity.  All retrospectives must be facilitated. The facilitator’s role is to give everyone a chance to talk about their concerns and give positive feedback. At the same time, they make sure the meeting remains a structured, productive meeting and doesn’t turn into just a moanfest. Ideally, your facilitator will be someone outside of your team so your whole team can contribute, but it’s not essential. The facilitator needs to: You’ll find it helpful to have some working agreements for a retrospective. These can be stated if necessary, eg in the first retrospective your team has. Working agreements could be that:  During the discussion you will uncover some successes you can celebrate, as well as some problems that you can fix or things you can improve. Make a list of actions that will address these. Aim to have done them within the next sprint or iteration. Some problems may take longer to fix, in which case you should try to make an action that will start the process of improving it by your next retrospective. Actions should: Retrospectives should follow up on the actions of previous retrospectives to make sure they’ve been completed. If they’re consistently not getting done, you may have too many.  You can use this template for your retrospectives. It’s based on a team of 8 to 10 and covers a 2-week sprint. 90 minutes is a reasonable amount of time to use for this scope and amount of people. Each of the activities is timeboxed (has a set time it will run for), and it’s your facilitator’s job to make sure that your team stick to this. Build in about 10% ‘shuffle time’ to move between activities to make sure it doesn’t overrun. Explain the scope, and if necessary, purpose. If your team don’t know each other and/or are shy, include brief introductions. Make sure they’ve been completed. If any haven’t, ask if:  Give your team around 10 minutes to write down all the things that went well in the previous 2 weeks on post-it notes. If anonymity is important to encourage free expression, collect them in and add them to the wall yourself. If not, have the team take turns adding their own post-its to the wall, possibly saying a few words about each. Don’t allow this to develop into a discussion at this point – you just want to gather data. Group the post-its into common themes. If there are too many to discuss in the time you have then have the team prioritise, eg by voting with stickers. Discuss each of the main areas in turn: Give the team around 15 minutes to write post-its for anything that went badly. Again, group the post-its, prioritise if necessary, and discuss the main areas:  Spend some time looking at the actions identified; assign them to people present and set realistic deadlines for completion. Total: 80 minutes with 10% shuffle time. It’s OK to finish early if people have said what they need to. It’s not OK to overrun – if there is too much to say, have the team prioritise the top areas for discussion and/or book more time for the next retrospective. Having a regular retrospective means you can: Agile development practices will help you work better, and the retrospective allows you to fine-tune the process and your environment to your needs.

It won’t stop you from using existing skills and knowledge, but it will require your team, users and stakeholders to start working together in new ways.  Prioritise features for users over everyone else – including your big, scary stakeholders - and ask for their feedback early and often. Really listen to your users. Even when they tell you things you don’t want to hear or disagree with. If possible, use data from real people that are using your product and let it influence the direction of our project. Constantly put users first.  Iterate often. Build something that strives to achieve the most valuable user need and show it to the users, listen to their feedback and improve it. Keep doing this until you have something so useful that they wouldn’t be without it. It might sound like over-simplifying the complexity of software development and project management, but agile development is all about “What do you want by next Friday?” The process of producing incremental, production-ready software allows your team to: Run a retrospective at the end of each delivery cycle or sprint to review what worked or what could be improved. Your team will continue to learn through delivery cycles and improve throughout the project.  Small teams of between 5 to 10 people are often more productive and predictable than larger teams. Forget man-days (the amount of work produced by an average worker in a day) and think about your team as a unit. A good team includes members with all of the skills necessary to successfully produce software. A fully functioning team has 3 main roles: Encourage your team members to pair up, as working together is beneficial. Two people working on one thing will: A good team means you’re able to estimate your output, or speed, very effectively and consistently. You can then plan much more accurately.

You can resolve issues, and stop issues from happening, by: Don’t be afraid to fail or experiment. Learn to fail, and create a culture that learns from failure.  It’s a myth that you don’t plan on agile projects.  The freedom of agile projects does not come free: you have to plan.  You just plan differently and continuously. Base your agile planning on solid, historical data, not theories or opinions. Your plan must continuously demonstrate its accuracy: nobody on your agile project should take it for granted that the plan is workable. Your teams should plan together, on at least 2 levels: Review these plans after every sprint and adjust them based on:  If your team is new to agile, be wary of familiar situations and reactions from having to do things differently.

Free chapter on “Writing User Stories” available at http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/books/user-stories-applied A user story briefly explains: User stories are an essential part of the agile toolkit. They’re a way of organising your work into manageable chunks that create tangible value, and can be discussed and prioritised independently. User stories are a technique which relies on other agile practices, including continuous delivery, and face-to-face communication with user representatives. It is not sufficient to simply ‘set’ a user representative: that user representative needs to be in the same place as the team and available to the team a sufficient amount of time. User stories can be added to a product backlog at any point in the sprint cycle by any person in the team. It’s up to the product owner to coordinate and prioritise them, and to select stories for each sprint at the start of each sprint cycle. Discuss the stories ahead of sprint planning with:  A user story is represented through a story card that has a title and a few lines of text. Your story cards can be virtual, as well as actual cards. On a large product/service keep your stories in a digital format, and then turn them into physical cards as part of sprint planning. When writing a user story, make sure the story is well-formed. Don’t skip the part explaining why there’s a need for a service just because it can be difficult. You might want to include a list of acceptance criteria. These should be an ‘aid memoire’ for things to test or check which may have come up during conversation, but they should not be used as a way of defining the scope of a story. If stories are too big then split them into smaller stories as they stand more chance of producing shippable (ready to use) code. Story cards follow a standard structure: They don’t capture every detail, but you should have a more in-depth discussion about a user story at the appropriate time. Building useful software systems is hard, so you need to make sure you’re solving the right problem. Agile methodologies emphasise an outside-in approach – what outcome is your service user trying to achieve? If you dive into the solution without a good understanding of your users, you risk solving the wrong problem, or coming up with solutions which don’t really work for your users in the real world. That’s why the most important part of a user story is the goal. Use this to help you decide whether the story is “done” or delivered, ie does the work meet the goal of the user? When writing stories with your development team, always start by thinking about and discussing your users’ goals: Suzanne and James Robertson have excellent advice on this in the book Mastering the Requirements Process (3rd edition). Being specific about the actor will help you to break down interactions into logical chunks. Sometimes the actor will be a user of your service, or the actor will be an administrator, technician or manager within your organisation. Make sure you already have a good understanding of your users from your initial project work or existing research. If not, take the time to develop that understanding. Use this as a reminder of the main interaction that needs to be addressed as part of the user experience. Remember that the story card does not need to spell out every detail. Agile teams prefer face-to-face conversation over detailed documentation. Face-to-face is: The story card is just a placeholder, a promise to have a conversation when the time is right. Use the story card and some brief initial conversations to estimate the amount of time a story needs to be completed and then put it into an agile backlog. When development work actually starts, consult the users or user representative to fill out the story details. A user story is the sum of all of these conversations, sketches and whiteboard diagrams - not just the card. You don’t need to write down or archive your conversations, but translate them directly into automated tests and working code. Using user stories in this way allows you to avoid ‘analysis paralysis’, the painful condition of trying to guess the details of some far-future goal. Acceptance criteria can be used to determine when a story is done. These follow a conversation between developer and user or user representative and are considered before coding begins. Only include these on the back of the story card if the team finds them useful for recording user assumptions they might later forget. Sometimes writing acceptance criteria on the story card is useful where the user or user representative is not immediately available but is no substitute at all for face-to-face conversation. The success of a user story is dependent on regular face-to-face communication between developers and users or user representatives. Your service manager and other user representatives need to be available to developers every day, and have enough time to think through and answer questions. Don’t underestimate how time-consuming this work can be! Stories can come from many places, but the most common sources include: See Chapter 4 of User Stories Applied.","description":"A user story briefly explains:","link":"/service-manual/agile/writing-user-stories.html"},{"title":"Assisted digital action plan","indexable_content":"Discovery: understand your users and their needs Alpha: develop options for assisted digital support Beta: public testing Live Support models 1.

You might be able to identity this from existing user insight, or you may need to commission more research to fill this gap.

Once you’ve identified your assisted digital users, start to gather more information about them. Again, this might be information you already have or new information you need to gather. Concentrate getting information on: If someone has internet access and skills, but prefers not to use the digital service, then they are targets for channel shift, not assisted digital. As part of your research, think about ways support for your service is already available. You can learn from this and make it part of the assisted digital support for your service. Support is already available if: This support may be formally put in place by your department, happening informally, or is part of the other organisations’ work, eg: At this stage, your understanding of user needs and existing support will be high level and have gaps, but you can fill these gaps as you progress through the service build. Now that you’ve completed steps 1 and 2, it’s time to develop a series of user stories for your assisted digital users: Read guidance on writing user stories for more information on how to do this. Think about using your service from start to finish - what do you think a user journey will look like? Concentrate on developing multiple user journeys. A simple way to do this is to visualise the process by drawing it out step by step, using a series of sticky notes to plot out the user journey. Each time a user interacts digitally in the transaction, consider the support that an assisted digital user would need. Use each of the user profiles / stories you’ve developed and think about how their needs could be met. Involve users and experts already supporting people who are offline to access services. You’ll have identified these people and what they do in the discovery phase. Involving them will help you to come up with better options for assisted digital support. You can do this at any stage of the process – and the more you do it, the better - but at the very least involve them at the stage. People you could involve are: GDS can introduce you to such organisations and have published information on work already carried out with these groups on the GDS blog. Contact the assisted digital team at GDS for more details. Consolidate your ideas and options into a list of preferred options for assisted digital support, bringing together: This will also help with forming your requirements for procuring this support from the private and voluntary sectors. Completing these steps means you’ll leave the alpha stage with: * an increased understanding of your users and their needs * options for your assisted digital support to test during the beta phase GDS, departments, and the Government Procurement Service have begun market engagement to set up a shared procurement route for commissioning assisted digital services. If you are not already involved in this work, please contact the assisted digital team at GDS. Develop a pilot of your proposed assisted digital option or options, and test it alongside the digital service with real assisted digital users. At a minimum, ask users if they were: Review the results of your beta test. Again, open up this review to users, experts and intermediaries. Act upon any lessons learnt from testing. Plan and commission assisted digital services from private and voluntary sector providers, based on your findings from the beta test. Work closely with colleagues developing plans for increasing digital take-up and phasing out existing alternative channels (eg paper channels) - criteria 11 and 24 of the Service Standard. Combined with your work on assisted digital, these will come together to help: GDS are developing shared models of assisted digital support to make sure consistency exists across all services. Once these models are in place, all services must follow them. Contact the GDS assisted digital team for more details. After 3-6 months, review your assisted digital support with your users, providers and external experts. Continue to ask users for their feedback, so you know that your support is still meeting their needs. If it isn’t meeting their needs, adjust your support according to the feedback.","description":"The assisted digital action plan will help you to:","link":"/service-manual/assisted-digital/action-plan.html"},{"title":"Blogging a service's progress","indexable_content":"Why use a blog Getting a blog How to write a blog post Writing for the right audience Blogs are used as a public record of the work and research being carried out by service teams throughout government. They’re an effective way of communicating with colleagues and stakeholders, and offer teams to share learning or ask for help in the creation of services that meet the Digital by Default Service Standard. Having high quality, regularly updated and publicly available evidence to demonstrate how services have met the standard is really important. It provides the whole of government with a repository of information to use in other similar service transformations, and an easy way of sharing ideas within and across departments. As a means of providing evidence for the standard, blogging has a relatively low impact on a team’s existing process. We expects posts to be regular and candid, reflecting the pace of development within an organisation and providing plenty of opportunity for members of a go live panel to review a teams progress in advance of the review. GDS is setting up a GOV.UK blogging platform to help services provide evidence in this way. It will be ready from the end of May. More details about how to set up a blog will be available soon. If your department or team already has a blog, there’s no need to start an additional one. Let us know where it is and GDS will make sure it is linked to from the GOV.UK platform, so there is one place that hosts all the service team blogs in government. The manual has plenty of useful resources explaining how to write effectively for an online audience. The guides on how government should write and how users read are a good place to start.  To get sense of the style and tone, look at the GDS or Ministry of Justice blogs. Service team blogs will be read by lots of different people. First, they will be read by the service’s users, the public. Amongst other things, that means resisting the use of acronyms and jargon as much as possible. Following this rule will also help senior internal stakeholders to use the blog for a quick overview of the team’s progress. They will also be read by the go live panel to help determine whether a service is ready to be launched. Clarity on what has been done and why, and pointing to evidence for taking decisions on service design will be what they look for in their assessments. Woolly words and unsubstantiated assertions will not help. Other teams in government will read the blogs to find out how people going through similar challenges overcame them. Blog posts should therefore be written with some consideration of any broader application an approach, tool or technique may have. That applies as much to things that didn’t work as things that did.","description":"Blogs are used as a public record of the work and research being carried out by service teams throughout government.

review them once your digital service is up and running enter into outsourcing contracts which discourage providers from promoting channel shift (eg paying per call handled) It’s essential to increase the take-up of government digital services so more users can experience the benefits of redesigned government services. Increased take-up will also make it possible for assisted digital support to be focused on those who are unable to use the digital service.  Digital take-up is one of the four key performance indicators your service will need to benchmark, measure and monitor in order to meet the Digital by Default Service Standard. In 2012, Digital Landscape Research found that 82% of the population were online and over 60% of people had used online banking. Yet the take-up of most government digital services was well below those figures. The following steps have proven to be successful in ‘shifting’ people away from using traditional (non-digital) channels, eg over-the-counter services and telephone helplines, to using digital services. They will help to resolve your users’ issues and concerns (real and perceived) when using your digital service, such as: These 10 steps will generate a higher take-up for services aimed at individual end-users (for ideas to promote digital take-up by businesses, see the Cabinet Office Case studies (PDF, 344KB).) Use this information as a step-by-step checklist for increasing your digital take-up. Every action is important and should be considered and seriously attempted. Your digital take-up will not be as successful if you: You need those who can use digital services to do so as soon as possible. It will cut costs and improve assisted digital support. The Government Digital Strategy requires departments to review their channel shift plans every year. Sheffield Channel Shift project promotes digital through partnership working.

Your services must also comply with any other legal requirements, including providing services in accordance with your Welsh Langage Scheme, if you have one. As a starting point, your service should aim to meet Level AA of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0. Your service should be tested by disabled people, older people, and people who use assistive technologies. You should aim to do this at least twice as your service is developed. Find out more about how to conduct accessibility testing We work hard to make our sites and services as accessible and usable as we can for everyone who needs to use them. The GOV.UK website does not include a separate accessibility statement, however, as we are not comfortable with a statement that draws a distinction between accessibility and any other aspect of best practice development. This blogpost by GDS accessibility expert Léonie Watson explains in more detail why we took this decision. Your service should be usable by recent versions of Jaws, NVDA, VoiceOver, Window Eyes and Supernova screen readers, ZoomText, MAGic and basic operating system screen magnifiers, as well as speech recognition software including Dragon Naturally Speaking, and native operating system speech packages. HTML is quicker, easier and more widely usable/accessible than PDF, but where no other option is possible the following PDF guidance should be followed. There is more information on choosing appropriate formats Accessibility is more than checking the boxes of standards compliance. When writing content, consider what information would be useful to people with access needs. For instance, in a ‘find my nearest’ service, consider user needs like: Is there disabled parking? How far is it from the entrance? What’s the terrain like? Uphill? Downhill? Will I have to cross any roads? etc. If you want to read more about the accessibility testing we’ve carried out while building GOV.UK, this blog post by GDS Accessibility Lead Joshua Marshall will tell you more.","description":"The services we provide are for the benefit of all citizens of the United Kingdom.

Due to the large range of browsers, devices and resolutions of access routes, it is to be expected that the user’s experience of a service will vary as the technical capabilities on browsers and devices vary. You must verify that your service works across a representative range of these devices and browsers, and makes accommodations for creating good experiences in all of them. These are the browsers we recommend testing on when developing your service.  This list strongly recommends testing on a range of browsers created within the last 3 years that cover the largest representation of the user base. This list is based upon usage statistics for GOV.UK.  It allows for a 95% coverage of all browsers used (the remaining browsers are individually insignificant). Browsers not listed may still work well, and it should be noted that this is not a list that intends to suggest that these are the only browsers the service will work on - this is simply a benchmark for testing against to ensure that the service will likely work for as many users as possible alongside appropriate cost-effectiveness and development overhead. Services should ensure there is a obvious way for users to report problems they may find, and additional testing and adjustments should be made upon receiving such a report. Note: An exception is made for IE6, as this is still in large-scale use in government departments. Two distinct levels of support are given and denoted next to each browser. Where ‘latest version’ is listed, it means the latest stable version plus one version back, as these browsers regularly self-update. Digital by default services must take into consideration the limitations of the browsers people use to access them. One important idea for achieving this is progressive enhancement. This recognises that different bits of technology have different capabilities. Whilst everybody gets access to core functionality, those using more sophisticated technology get an enhanced experience. Progressive enhancement is also important in delivering a consistent experience to people using mobile devices or those who may have limited bandwidth. Because mobile traffic now accounts for 13% of all internet use in the UK and around 20% of traffic to GOV.UK, this mode of access is not an optional extra to consider. Where we might previously have developed separate mobile and desktop versions of a service, or bought bespoke apps, design should now be done with one website in mind. This should be done using a responsive design approach. This means websites adapt to suit the dimension of the screen being used to view it. Don’t try to build services for every possible combination of operating system and browser. Avoid the temptation of designing for the obvious without first researching your users. Every service has an audience and you should investigate yours to see whether it has particular characteristics that you need to be aware of. Do you have existing data for the browsers and devices that your audience has been using already? If so, analyse it to see if you can identify any patterns in usage, or any combinations of: This data may sometimes support the case for deprioritising certain development work: although most of GOV.UK is designed to work across all screen sizes, the Trade Tariff team chose not to tailor their tool to the smaller screen as it is largely used by office workers between 9 and 5. Equally, if your audience is likely to include those from within the public sector there may be higher use of older, more limited browsers. Channel shift means you must also consider your potential future audience. It is anticipated that operating system, browser and device data from GOV.UK will be published as part of the GDS performance platform and this will provide a valuable insight into the audience for government services. Before launch we noted a marked difference between the existing non-government and government audiences so you should also investigate the data provided by NetMarketShare and GlobalStats who can provide UK and global trends. It is important to distinguish between those browsers and operating systems whose popularity is either increasing or holding steady and those for which the opposite is true. Although Internet Explorer versions 6 and 7 have only been used by a minority (almost 5% of the total visits to GOV.UK since launch) this still accounts for a significant number of individuals who government services must take into account. However, over time this will change. So it is important to set thresholds for abandoning support and for adopting new and emergent platforms. The iPad Mini, Kindle Fire, Windows 8 and Internet Explorer 10 highlight this dilemma - recently launched products might not appear in any data but it is likely that they will eventually enjoy widespread use. Decisions about compatibility can not be something you specify at the start of the project and then forget about. Transformed digital services need to reflect and adapt to the broader internet context of their users on an ongoing basis. James Weiner writes about the decisions made about browser support for the Beta of GOV.UK (January 2012) Ben Welby discusses the operating systems, browsers and devices supported for the launch of GOV.UK (October 2012).

To do that, we need to have a consistent visual grammar, for use both within GDS and across government. This guide sets out four principles of good data presentation, with easy to follow checklists to help you achieve this. For context, we’ve added examples of how the principles have been employed at GDS. The principles and examples found in this guide are likely to evolve over time, as we find new challenges and applications for them. There are many examples of best practice style guides already in place. For example, The Economist has a clearly defined house style that allows its readers to readily identify and understand their visualisations. They publish a new visualisation every day in their Graphic Detail. This guide attempts to build on the best practice from a range of organisations. The GOV.UK Performance Platform helps the Government make decisions based on data, often presented through innovative visualisations (built using D3.js). The example below compares weekly visitors to GOV.UK with the two main websites it replaced.  To effectively tell the story behind the numbers, you need to understand both your audience and the data. Only use visualisations if they make the story clearer. In many cases, a good table or words may communicate better. If there are very few data points (eg top rate income tax down 5%, all other rates unchanged), it’s clearer to write a sentence than draw a picture. If every item must be read precisely (to several decimal places) then a table is best. A good table will be clear and uncluttered. The data should be easy to read with the same decimal places or rounding and sorted into a logical order. Don’t use too many different types of font, and make sure your data is referenced. But visualisations often are the right answer and the data is the most important feature. It should tell its own story and it is best to not try to say too much in one go. Keep charts simple, cutting down on unnecessary items and jargon. Explanatory text will be needed in some cases, but it should not simply repeat the story being told in the visualisation. A well written chart title can reinforce the story of the data and reduce the amount of additional text needed. Choosing the right visualisation will help the data tell its own story and give powerful insight. There are many ways of displaying information visually. This guide focuses on charts. GDS has produced a guide to infographics. Most computer programmes come with a range of visualisations. There are also visualisation tools available online, this blog showcases some free ones. Each chart has its own strength. Below are the core 5 with templates, a google spreadsheet of these is available  Strengths - comparing items, or a small number of time periods.  Strengths - comparing items, especially if they have long names or many items.  Strengths - comparing over time or between variables for a single item (eg site traffic vs site performance)  Strengths - simple share of total. Use with caution, column or bar charts are often better. Limit to two segments to avoid confusion.  Strengths - relationships between variables where there are many items (eg volume vs cost for numerous transactions) There is more help on choosing the right chart here. It is important to not confuse your audience. Choosing the correct visualisation is important and at GDS we reviewed what was being used in the performance dashboard. As the example below shows, Pie charts with many items are not clear. We used a stacked bar chart to better represent the data.   Keep in mind these useful tips when creating your charts. Keeping your visualisation simple will help the data tell its own story. Chartjunk is anything in your visualisation using ink that actively reduces clarity. Avoid: Know your audience so you give the right amount of supporting information. External or non-technical audiences will need more explanation but internal or expert audiences may find this tedious. Do not use the text to simply repeat what is being said by the data. Visualisations should avoid too much data. Only include what is relevant. If the trend is obvious, don’t include a trendline. Sometimes it may be more effective to focus on high value items only (if you are being selective, be open and clear about this). Poor colour choice can change how the data is perceived in a visualisation. For example, red is strongly associated with negative performance so is best avoided for positive/normal figures. Colour blindness makes it difficult for a user to differentiate between data sets. Labelling charts directly and different line styles can help. If your visualisations are likely to be printed it is important the colours work in greyscale as not all users will have high quality printers. The example below from GDS’ senior management dashboard shows how avoiding chart junk and limiting the number of datasets can enhance your visualisation.  The legend accounts for a quarter of display space. The Y axis quotes £ and not £m. The segments are profiles and proportionate for each time period, so the bright colouring adds no extra detail. The mix of bar and line is confusing with so much information in the chart.  The stacked column gave a level of detail which was not needed. This has been rationalised to best suit the audience. Axes have been standardised. The legend has been relocated giving the chart more space. Heavy grid lines and axes have been removed to give a clearer display. “We want transparency to become an absolutely core part of every bit of government business.” - Francis Maude Being open and transparent supports the Open Data white paper agenda. Similarly, our Open Public Services agenda is built on transparency. Sourcing data builds trust and credibility. Providing contact information shows ownership but also helps collaboration and information sharing. When presenting data be aware of axes and scales. Data can be misrepresented by only showing a selection if it is not clear why an extract has been chosen. Consider where the visualisation might be published. For example, if published alongside other visualisations the reader is likely to assume the scales are consistent. This might change how your data is perceived.

Government transactions typically involve an exchange of information, money, rights, goods or some combination of these. Usually one party will be a citizen or business and the other will be the government. For example, when someone applies for a passport they exchange information and money for the right to travel.  A service is made up of a collection of related or connected transactions. Most digital transactions take the form of a dialogue between the user and a system, which acts on behalf of the other party. It’s the system’s interface which determines in large part the quality of the overall user experience. The dialogue between a user and a system can be realised in different ways. It might resemble a verbal conversation, with the system asking questions and the user answering them. It might be more visual, with the user querying the system by interacting with a map or diagram.  Either way, you’ll need to decide what kind of interface best fits your transaction and how to structure it. It can help people understand how to use your service if you adopt an appropriate design metaphor for your interface. Interface metaphors can come from the physical or digital world and include things like address book, library, trash can, email inbox, timeline, bank statement, pinboard etc. Avoid the temptation to go over the top with any physical metaphors (we don’t want to see any leatherbound address books with bookmarks sticking out of them). You should choose a structure for your transaction that most naturally fits the ways your users are going to want to use it. Ask yourself: How you answer these questions will help you decide how to structure the transaction. It can help to think in terms of levels: sections, subsections, groups etc. Try not to worry about how those levels should be represented in the interface until you have a broader understanding of the overall structure. For example, on a web site, you might choose to have one section per page, or multiple sections per page. It depends on what’s going to work best for your users. All sections are positioned on a single page.  Each section goes on it’s own page.  All sections on a single page, but each new section only appears once the previous section has been completed.  Done well, option 3 is a hybrid of the other two that has benefits of both the other options. Within this hybrid option there are still some important design decisions to make. For example: For more complicated transactions, some combination of the other options might be your best bet.  Again, done well this can give you the benefits of both the single page and wizard approaches. It also allows you to create a sense of rhythm to the overall flow, which can help people to understand when they have moved into a different part of the transaction, and break up the monotony of filling in forms. As always, these design decisions must have a strong, user-centred rationale behind them. If the average time to complete a transaction is more than you can reasonably expect your users to spend in a single session, then you’ll need to provide a way for them to save their progress. The same goes if the session is likely to be interrupted for some reason. For example, if the user is suddenly asked for information which they might not have immediately to hand (a way to mitigate against this is to warn users up front if they’re going to be asked for that kind of information). Saving progress does not necessarily mean you require user accounts, logins, email validation etc. For simpler transactions that don’t store personal information you might be able to store the data in the URL itself. The user then simply has to bookmark that URL. For more complex transactions that don’t store personal data you might be able to offer users a unique, and hard-to-guess URL that they can use to get back to their session. If you follow the principle of not asking for information you don’t need, then most of your fields will be mandatory and you shouldn’t need to mark them as such with ‘*’ symbols or other conventions. Instead, mark the optional fields, by adding ‘(optional)’ to their label. You should be aiming for a service that’s so intuitive people don’t need any help in using it. If you find yourself explaining the interface within the interface it’s a sign that something has gone wrong. Time to try out some different ideas. The following principles may help: Sometimes though, people are going to need extra help. Many government transactions involve concepts and terminology that people will be unfamiliar with. Some of this stuff takes a lot of explaining - so we need a way of providing contextual help of varying degrees of detail throughout a transaction. Here are three approaches: Here are a few principles to keep in mind when you’re designing transactions. The further in to a transaction someone gets, the more time they have invested in it and the greater their annoyance if they have to abandon it for some reason. Be honest about what you’re offering users, and what you’re not offering them. In particular, people need to know up front about the following: Use common sense though. Don’t try to make everyone to read a page of terms and conditions before they start (they won’t). The best approach is to meet (or exceed) people’s expectations. For example, if your delivery times are typical and you accept all the usual payment methods then you wont need to warn everyone about them up front. For example, if the underlying process is inherently non linear then choose an interface that works well with non-linear processes. If you try to fit a process into a model it’s unsuited for you’ll confuse your users and confound their expectations. Remembering the broader context in which a transaction exists, including the emotional states of the people involved and the  broader situations or activites that the transaction is embedded in. Don’t assume that your users already understand all the concepts and terminology used in your transaction. A few people will want to read up on all that stuff before they start, but many will choose to dive straight in. You need to support both types of people. Every request for information from the user: Asking for information because ‘it might be useful’ or ‘it helps with our record keeping’ is not acceptable.","description":"It’s an exchange between two or more parties.","link":"/service-manual/design-and-content/designing-transactions.html"},{"title":"How users read","indexable_content":"Reading Reading age Lowercase Plain English Context Learning disabilities Why we do this Further reading The style guide is set in best practice and relates to how users read. This is an explanation of some of our guidance and the reasons behind the rules. Users only really read 20-28% of a web page. With services, where users just want to complete the task as quickly as possible, you have added user impatience so you may find users skim words even more. The style guide and how we write give guidance on how to write. This page details why we do it. All of this guidance is based on the learning skills of an average person in the UK, who has English as a first language. You don’t read one word at a time. You bounce around. You anticipate words and fill them in. By the time you are 9 years old, your brain can drop up to 30% of the text and still understand. Your vocabulary will grow but this reading skill stays with you as an adult. You should also be confident in sounding out words and blending sounds. You may not know the word, but you have the skills to be able to learn it. We talk about the reading age being around 9 years old - this is why.  When you learn to read, you start with a mix of upper and lower case but you don’t start understanding uppercase until you are around 6 years old.  At first, you may sound out letters, merge sounds, merge letters, learn the word. Then you stop reading it. At that point, you recognise the shape of the word. This speeds up comprehension and speed of reading. So we don’t want people to read. We want people to recognise the ‘shape’ of the word and understand. It’s a lot faster.  Caps are reputed to be 13-18% harder for users to read. So we try to avoid them. Also, in modern usage it sounds like we are shouting. We are government. We should not be shouting. By the time you are 9, you are building up your ‘common words’. Your primary set is around 5,000 words in your vocabulary; your secondary set is around 10,000 words. These are words you use every day. They are a lot of your ‘plain English’ words. Which is why we should be obsessed with them. These are words so easy to comprehend, you learn to read them quickly and then you stop reading and start recognising.  We explain all unusual terms on GOV.UK. This is because you can understand 6-letter words as easily 2 letter words - if they are in context. Sometimes, you can read a short word faster than a single letter - if the context is correct. Not only are we giving users full information - which is obviously what we are meant to be doing - we are speeding up their reading time. By giving full context and using common words, we are allowing them to understand in the fastest possible way.  In tools and transactions you need to give people context. By giving them information they are expecting, you help them get through it faster.  This is a huge subject, with many different nuances. But one thing we can do is remember that people with some learning disabilities read letter for letter. They don’t bounce around like other users. They also can’t retain the comprehension of the sentence as a whole if it is too long. People with moderate learning disabilities can retain comprehension of 5 to 8 words. Now, we can’t go that far but if we concentrate on common words, we can get to the standard retention figure of around 25 words. Quite frankly, we all get a bit lost if you have a 72 word sentence. Again, why would we make it hard, when it can be so easy and we don’t lose the usability?  Our audience is potentially anyone living in the UK. We need to be able to communicate in a way that most users understand. Government can’t afford to be elitist and use language only those with a very good education can understand. We need to open up our information and services to everyone. That means using common words and working with natural reading behaviour.

Sometimes an application may require one or more ‘wet signatures’ to validate it, or print alternatives may be part of your assisted digital support. For the most part you can approach these as design challenges like any other - the Design Principles are a great way to start this work - but there are some specific things you will want to bear in mind. The most important thing to remember is that print forms should only be made when absolutely necessary. For example, the legislation governing Lasting Powers of Attorney requires ‘wet signatures’ for the application to be valid. Until this legislation changes, a print form has to be part of the final service. Aim for as much of the transaction as possible to be completed online. Users should have to print as little as possible in order to complete an application, which means: In lots of cases, paper forms will exist for services being redesigned. The launch of the digital service gives you an opportunity to improve them. When doing so, don’t just base your designs on the existing forms. Look at what information you need to carry out the transaction, and try to eliminate unnecessary steps.   Performance data should be available for the existing forms. This will tell you about the most common options people select and the kinds of mistakes they make. This will be useful information while you design the new forms. Links, smart answers, search boxes and drop downs are not available in print publications. If a transaction requires multiple forms you will need to make sure the design and layout helps users navigate them as easily as their online counterparts.  In the Lasting Power of Attorney application forms, this meant   Your paper forms are a small but important part of a digital process. Typically you’ll be switching to paper forms to collect a signature. Here are some ways you can make this transition easier: You should test your paper forms with real users. For complex forms, plan for 3 rounds of lab testing, making improvements to the form between each round. You’ll gain valuable insight by attending the user research in person. Get an introduction to user research and find out about all the different kinds of testing. Templates (based on the Lasting Power of Attorney application) created by teams across government will help you make easy-to-complete forms, but lots of the ‘heavy-lifting’ will be in making specialist terms and langauge accessible to the majority of users. Where specialist terms are unavoidable, or necessary, you will need people who understand how users read and how best to write for government services when working on the design. Skilled content designers and copywriters will make forms – whether online or in print – simpler and clearer, improving the completion rate and user satisfaction in the process. They complement the digital transaction, and should be easy to process by staff working to support the digital service. Their performance also has an impact on the KPIs you gather for digital services. Contact us if you’re starting work on print forms. We can send you the LPA form pack to use as a template. (The redesigned LPA forms will be made public soon by the MOJ as part of a formal consultation.) If you get the error ‘There is no application set to open the document…’, you don’t have InDesign installed.

Alternative colours should be possible but only to indicate different actions.

Sometimes you want a single button to perform more than one action. For example, ‘Save and quit’. It’s worth trying to avoid this situation but if you can’t, use common sense. If one of the actions is obvious or not important to know, don’t mention it. For example, if a button saves the current state and moves the user to the next screen, don’t use ‘Save and next’, just use ‘Next’, because users will assume the former.

NB: VoiceOver does not provide shortcut keys for navigating by headings or graphics. The best way to create an accessible PDF is to create an accessible source document. Well structured Microsoft Word documents make good source documents for conversion to PDF. When a source document is converted into PDF it is tagged. The PDF tag tree reflects the structure of the document, and it’s this structure that assistive technologies like screen readers use to navigate the document. Use the styles and features available in Word to format your content and give it structure. This will make it easier to convert your source document into PDF because it lays the groundwork for the PDF tag tree. Use the heading styles in Word to create a logical document structure. Don’t increase the size of text or make it bold to create the appearance of headings. Treat your document like a book: It should have one title (level one heading) and multiple chapters (level two headings). Within each chapter there may be multiple sections (level three headings) and sub sections (level four headings). Use the list styles in Word to group together related items. If the items follow a specific sequence, use a numbered list instead. Don’t use punctuation or other markers to create the illusion of a list. If your document is longer than a few pages, use Word to automatically create a table of contents based on your heading structure. Don’t use lists and links to manually create a table of contents. Use left aligned text (unless the language of your document is read right to left). Don’t use justified text in your document. Choose a san serif font and use the styles in Word to set it as the default, with a minimum size of 12pt. If you need to include footnotes or other text of a smaller size, increase the size of the body text to 14pt, rather than reduce the size of text below 12pt. Don’t use chunks of italicised or capitalised text, and don’t underline text unless it’s a link. Use foreground/background colours for text that have a good contrast ratio. The 4.5:1 ratio recommended by the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 is a good minimum. Don’t use colour or shape as the only way to identify something in your document. Use text labels or descriptions instead. Use tables with column headings to display data. Don’t use tables to make cosmetic changes to the layout of the document. Use Word to add text descriptions to all important images in the document. Make sure the text description includes all the information contained within, or conveyed by, the image. Use Adobe Acrobat Pro to convert your Word document into PDF. Use the Convert to PDF option under the Adobe menu in Microsoft Word to do this. This will ensure that Acrobat picks up the accessibility you have built into your source document. Set the language of the document. Go to File > Properties > Advanced and select a language from the Language menu. If the PDF is written in Welsh, type CY into the box. All content must be tagged, marked as an artefact (background content), or removed from the tag tree. Use the Tags panel to review and edit the tag tree. If the PDF was converted from a well structured Word document, the tag tree should require little editing. If the PDF contains form fields, use Advanced > Accessibility > Touch up reading order to check they can be navigated with the tab key in a logical order. If the tab order needs improving, use the Order panel to drag and drop the fields into the correct order. Use the Tags panel to review and edit the reading order of the PDF. Don’t rely on the visual order of the PDF. The reading order is based on the structure of the PDF tag tree, which may not match the visual content order. Use View > Zoom > reflow then check that the PDF still has a logical reading order. Note: It can sometimes be difficult to guarantee a logical reflow order for PDfs with complex content. Go to Advanced > Accessibility > Touch up reading order and check that all images have text descriptions. If the text descriptions were present in the source Word document and the Convert to PDF option was used, the text descriptions should already be present in the PDF. Remove empty tags from the tag tree. Use the Tags panel to highlight and delete any empty tags from the tag tree. Tag decorative content elements as artefacts. Use Advanced > Accessibility > Touch up reading order to select a decorative element, and use the Background button to make the element an artefact. Use the Tags panel to check the structure of data tables. The <table>, <tr> and <td> tags should be used to give data tables the proper structure. Use the Tags panel to check that links are active. Active links should be tagged with the <link> tag. Use File > Preference > Accessibility to set a high contrast colour scheme, and check the PDF remains readable. Note: It may not be possible to make high contrast mode work in all PDFs, in which case you should be prepared to make a high contrast version available on request. Display the document title instead of the file name. Go to File > Properties > Initial view and select Document title from the Show drop down box. Once all the above steps have been taken, the PDF should be checked before it is published. Go to Advanced > Accessibility and select Full check. The PDF should pass the full check for WCAG 2.0 Level AA without any warnings. Ask a screen reader user to read through the PDF. If no-one is available to do this, use one of the following options instead. Non Visual Desktop Access (NVDA) is a free open source screen reader for Windows. It can be installed to the desktop or run from a portable USB thumb drive. With NVDA running, open the PDF and use the following commands to check the PDF: VoiceOver is the integrated screen reader with Mac OS X and all iOS devices. In Mac OS X turn VoiceOver on (or off again) using Command + F5. With VoiceOver running open the PDF and use the following commands to check the PDF: Thanks to the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) for enabling us to incorporate its accessibility best practice guidance into this document.","description":"The best way to create an accessible PDF is to create an accessible source document.

Browsers have default styling for forms. This is usually shared with the styling of the operating system user interface (UI), making it familiar to users. Ensure that any styling you add does not remove any of the native, highly accessible functionality offered by these defaults. The HTML5 specification should be consulted for guidance on creating the HTML. This is more important than with other HTML elements as some types of user will depend on proper use of the language. For example it is important each form element has a label describing it otherwise screenreaders will not be able to identify it properly. In the forms created so far on GOV.UK certain patterns of display have emerged as solutions to common UI problems. What follows is a guide to those patterns. The base pattern for grouping controls is in a column with one row for each control and it’s label.           Job offers          Networking          Business opportunities        You might occasionally need to arrange your group of controls in a row, for instance if they have short labels and there are only a few options.               Male              Female            You may want to pre-check radios if: Do not pre-check radios if: In the examples above the controls are wrapped in their associated label tag.  The default behaviour of clicking a label will move focus to its associated form element. By wrapping a form element in its label you increase the size of the area users need to click to interact with that element to whatever size you make the label. There are valid cases for top, left or right alignment of labels. The position of an element’s label does not effect how screenreaders announce it to users.  The table below (from a great article on form design in Smashing Magazine) outlines the relative advantages of each approach: All form elements other than submission buttons should have a label. For situations where a label would not fit into the visual interface the label should be hidden from view. Hiding labels should be done with care as by doing so you are taking information away from the user. Labels should never be hidden by using display: none as this will also remove them from the document flow meaning they will not be recognised by screenreaders. In the example below the second input box has a hidden label. It is associated with the first input box visually by its position. For non-visual users it is important the label is present to provide this information.          Street                   Street line two                   Town/City                   Postcode          When styling form elements we should try to achieve the same goals as the default styling through our own CSS. A few examples of how to achieve this for input fields: As explained in their HTML5 specification section fieldsets are used to break up forms into logical sections.              First name                           Last name              There are times when you might want to treat a set of form controls like they were a single, compound control  (a date-of-birth selector for example). One way to do this is with a nested fieldset.            Full name                           Day               Day                Month               Month                Year               Year Hints for help with interactions can be placed above or below the relevant control.          Telephone         Include your country code                 Code         The three numbers on the back of the card                 Password         Make it at least six characters long          By default buttons should be horizontally left-aligned beneath the form inputs (not necessarily left aligned with the labels, and not right aligned on the page). The primary action should be the first button in the group.            Full name                        See the separate page on buttons for more detailed guidance. Summarise any validation errors at the top of your page like this: Each link should jump the user down to the corresponding form control. The red bar visually connects the summary to the messages in the form and aids quick scanning of the form for errors. To see all the examples above in a single form, check out the registration form example. The CSS for those styles is derived from this SASS file.

Irregular grids use first-child rather than nth-child. For multiple rows you’ll need to pass in a $max-rows variable representing the maximum number of rows in the grid. IE 6: All grid elements display 100% width Use this mixin if you need to arrange content in a grid, or split part of a page into columns. You might want to do this for an image gallery, product catalogue or home page layout for example. It’s particularly useful if you don’t want to explicitly represent rows or columns in the markup. The mixin accepts the following arguments: $columns : The number of columns in the grid, or an array representing the relative width of each column. $min-height : An optional minimum height for grid elements. Useful if your grid elements contain varied amounts of content. $max-rows : Adds IE7,8 support for grids with varied column widths. See below for details. The mixin is tag-agnostic, so the elements can be list items, divs, paragraphs etc. Avoid applying border effects to the elements as this will throw out the widths. Instead, style the contents of those elements. At mobile screen sizes the grid elements switch to being full-width. Item 1 Item 2 Item 3 Item 4 Item 5 Item 6 Item 7 Item 8 You can create grids of equally-sized elements by passing in a single value representing the number of elements in a row.

GOV.UK has a collection of Sass files which are bundled up into a gem for easy inclusion into new projects. For projects not written in Ruby note that the gem is just a wrapper for the GOV.UK Frontend toolkit, a repositry containing all the files. The files in the gem can be categorised into three different things: The first is the key bit which makes GOV.UK projects look the same. There are a collection of pre-defined font-sizes that we use on GOV.UK. There is a mixin for each one, for example heading-26. These also include a standard amount of whitespace around the text to help with vertical rhythm on the page, spacing things out nicely. The second is a way to develop sites that can respond to being on different sized displays.  The third is a very easy way of writing IE specific CSS in the middle of our stylesheets without using hacks. The forth is a way to keep browser specific styles out of our projects. We encapsulate new or non-standardised CSS into mixins. In this way we can easily update all the instances of a new CSS property without having to do a search and replace across all of our projects. It is generally advised to write your markup with a mobile and up attitude. That is, add desktop styles to an otherwise narrow screen stylesheet. In this way you only add styles for desktop and don’t reset desktop styles for a mobile device. There are two types of cross browser technique. There are some which are just for encapsulating vendor prefixes. Then there are some for using different methods to achieve a consistent effect. An example of these are: The border-radius line here is designed to use the different border-radius implementations to create a standard border-radius. The contain-floats however, uses a cross-browser techinque to ensure that the element wraps all of the floated elements within it. It is not a property that normally exists in CSS but is something we often need to do and don’t want to use different techniques everywhere.

Static Frontend govuk_frontend_toolkit Shared asset libraries are helpful for using the same frontend and branding on multiple services. When building services around patterns and consistency, it’s important to share your frontend assets so that they can be easily reused as required. There’s are two additional benefits to this approach: The templates on GOV.UK are constantly changing as we react to user feedback and evolving best practice, so the best place to find them is on our open source frontend libraries - more explanation of these to follow: The static repository contains our wrapper templates, our basic CSS, and our basic Javascript. Anything added to this repository is built to be used across the entire gov.uk website and is used to provide a consistent look and feel. The frontend repository contains the wrapper templates and views for many of the various pages used across gov.uk. It gives a good indication as to how to structure HTML and assets together. Please see Sass repositories for more information on this repository. The template code contains direct links to CSS and JavaScript assets hosted on the GOV.UK domain. We recommend that you leave these links as is whilst you develop your service (as opposed to linking to your own copies of these files). That way, you’ll always be using the latest version of the assets and when they change you can identify and resolve any conflicts immediately. Once the service is ready for production we’ll need to decide whether you should continue to link to the assets in this way or whether you should now use your own copies of them. Please contact GDS to discuss this at the appropriate time. GOV.UK is continuously being improved, which means that template and asset code changes regularly. All services on GOV.UK are expected to keep their templates and assets up-to-date. How you do this will depend on how you implement the templates and where your service is hosted. Please contact the GDS team to discuss options.","description":"Shared asset libraries are helpful for using the same frontend and\nbranding on multiple services.","link":"/service-manual/design-and-content/resources/shared-asset-libraries.html"},{"title":"Typography","indexable_content":"The GOV.UK typeface Using New Transport Colour contrast Type size Further reading Why we’ve chosen Transport. Shared asset libraries Sass Repositories Colour palettes Accessibility requirements Services should use clear, easy to read type, with consistent styles and a clear hierarchy of information. GOV.UK uses the typeface New Transport, cut especially for Government use. This typeface is embedded in the GOV.UK CSS and is served to browsers via a WOFF file (or an EOT file for Internet Explorer 8). The font is hinted to display well on all browsers. Older browsers do not receive the typeface. We currently use two weights of New Transport: Light and Bold. Italics should not be used. The number of different type sizes on a page should be kept to the minimum, and only one typeface/font should be used on each website. New Transport is not licenced for use outside of the GOV.UK domain. When your service goes live you’ll be given access to the typeface. If the service uses numbers in columns or tables, you should change these to use the tabular number version of New Transport. This replaces the standard numbers with new versions that have a fixed width. The main noticable difference is a base on the character 1. GDS has used this on the Performance Platform and Trade Tariff. Text must have enough contrast against the background colour to be readable. This should be tested to conform with our Accessibility requirements. Generally we use type in #0B0C0C against a white or light grey background. Links should be blue and underlined - see Colour palettes. Type should be large enough to be easily read. This is generally larger than many current websites: 36px for headlines, 19px for body text. This can be included using default styles in scss from the Frontend Toolkit. These include line height spacing that works across browsers.","description":"Services should use clear, easy to read type, with consistent styles and a clear hierarchy of information.","link":"/service-manual/design-and-content/resources/typography.html"},{"title":"Writing for transactions","indexable_content":"Writing microcopy Writing help text Transaction start pages Transaction end pages Further reading General guidance Asking for personal details Inline help Progressive disclosure Pop-up help window Describe the service Set expectations Use sentence case Address the user directly Follow the style guide Don’t use ‘please’ on labels - but give polite, clear, short instructions Don’t use colons after labels Don’t add ‘your’ to labels, for example: ‘Your name’, ‘Your address’, unless you have a page with multiple people where you need to differentiate - for example: ‘your name’, ‘partner name’ ‘First name’ not ‘Christian name’ ‘Middle names’ ‘Last name’ not ‘Family name’ ‘Age’ ‘Date of birth’ (not ‘DOB’) that they have successfully completed the transaction what further actions they need to perform, and when what further actions they can expect from the service, and when who they should contact with any queries or complaints about any related information and services Microcopy is the term given to the short words or phrases used during transactions, for things like buttons, form labels, help text, alerts and questions. Your first strategy when it comes to help text is to design a service that’s so intuitive it doesn’t need any. For this reason it helps to stick to interface design conventions where possible. Avoid innovation for its own sake - the real innovation is an easy to use government service. Sometimes though, users need a little help. Here are some ways of providing it.          Telephone         Include your country code        Use this to provide examples for unfamiliar information requests or formats. This refers to help that appear on a page when the user interacts with a link, but remains hidden otherwise. It’s useful for delivering important help to some users, without distracting or confusing everyone else. For this reason it’s particularly useful for dealing with edge case user scenarios. This is the nuclear option and should only be considered as a last resort. Popups or lightboxes should ONLY be used for delivering help relating to the concepts or terminology involved in a service or transaction. If you’re using one to explain how to USE a service then you need to go back and make the interface more intuitive. The start point for any GOV.UK transaction should be a page on the GOV.UK domain. Users should not be able to jump to a later page in the service via some other means (eg Google). The design of the start page will be determined by the nature of the service and its audience. All start pages should meet the following goals: The page should include the name of the service, expressed as an action if possible (‘Renew your passport’, Claim for disability allowance’, ‘Book a driving test’ etc.). If you need to, include a very brief description of the service. People will tend to base their expectations of what a transaction involves on their experience of other digital transactions, for example, online shopping and banking. If your service has features that do not match these expectations then you should inform your users of this as early on as possible, ideally on the start screen. Users should be told about any financial costs or long waiting periods involved. If they’ll be asked to provide relatively obscure information let them know so they can get it ready. If there are specific eligibility requirements for the service let people know. If the eligibility requirements are complex you should consider using the Smart Answer format to help people understand whether or not they are eligible. It’s better to ask a few questions up front (and explain why you’re doing this) than to let people invest time and effort in a transaction only to discover part way through that they’re not eligible to use it. The end point of any transaction should be a page on the GOV.UK domain. These pages should let the user know: Information on designing forms that work on the formsthatwork.com site","description":"Microcopy is the term given to the short words or phrases used during transactions,\nfor things like buttons, form labels, help text, alerts and questions.","link":"/service-manual/design-and-content/resources/writing-for-transactions.html"},{"title":"Working with prototypes","indexable_content":"Building prototypes Ideas can be ugly The best way to understand a product is to try to build it. Prototyping is an essential process to get a feel for the shape and edges of a product, to begin to estimate the work involved and to provide something you can quickly test with real users. This is a vital part of a process often known as ‘product discovery’: understanding your users and their needs, developing a sense of how you might serve those needs, and estimating the effort involved in building and running a service to do so. We built alpha.gov.uk as a prototype of what would later become the single domain www.gov.uk. It was built quickly without much concern to scalability, resilience, or any of the other considerations of a ‘real’ product, because none of those matter unless the core concept is sound. That allowed us to get feedback early and also understand some of the trickier concepts we would have to grapple with such as the fuzzy lines between different audiences, the operational processes that would be required, and so on. Prototyping can start on paper with sketches. Hand-drawn sketches of what a service might involve are a good way to begin thinking things through. We encourage everyone to get to running code as quickly as possible. It’s only when you start working in the same medium your users will be using (for online services that’s generally a web browser, but it may also be via an API) that you can really understand the experience you need to provide. The smart answer format for GOV.UK began as a series of paper sketches refined over a week by a small team. That process gave them a good sense of the boundaries of the problem they were trying to solve. As quickly as possible we prototyped the format using HTML and javascript so that it could be experienced in a web browser. That revealed more constraints, such as the fact that users might expect to be able to go back and amend an answer without realising that would change their whole journey through the format. This allowed us to quickly adjust the user interface to be clearer for its users before we started the work of building out the full system. Running code also forces you to think about your integrations with other services and how they might work – do you need to send email? integrate with an existing database? and so on. A prototype will rarely actually include these integrations but having a clear picture of them is vital if you’re going to understand the real effort involved in building and operating the service.","description":"The best way to understand a product is to try to build it.

You may want to read: how users read this will tell you more about user reading behaviour - which will help when designing the content for your service. All services should follow the GOV.UK style guide. The way we talk to users is the same on all GOV.UK products. The only difference is the format. Services should be intuitive and government services should provide an exceptional user experience. You shouldn’t need many words at the top of the page and none of it should be instructions on how to use the service. If you need to manage a user’s expectations, tell them on the pre-transaction page, not on the service page. If you do have to add text, keep your sentences very specific, short, active (keeping the subject and verb close) and in plain English. Users won’t want to read much on a tool or transaction. They will want to click, answer questions and get to the end as quickly as possible. It’s unlikely they will read much at all, so only tell them what you need to. Don’t use terms like ‘my benefits’ etc. This will mean different things to different users. Some will think it is a list of all the benefits they have had, some will think it is an online account to manage benefits and others won’t know what to think. Don’t use puns or clever terms. Keep the service title clear, short and specific. Keep page titles specific to the questions on the page. If the page is just about the user’s address, call it ‘your address’. Don’t call it ‘about you’. However, if you are covering a number of different elements of ‘about you’ on the page - you can. Make sure you need any question you include in your service. Don’t include questions that you think you might need later or for another part of your organisation. Keep the transaction as specific as possible to the task the user is trying to complete. Jargon is used differently by different people, so you will be opening up the language to misinterpretation. We lose trust if we use spin or try to ‘convince’ a user of something. Give them the facts they need and don’t try to encourage. The facts should speak for themselves - if the information is clear enough, the user will make their own decision. You use fewer eye muscles to look down than you do across. That might be why users prefer to scan down a page and not across. By providing clear, specific subheads you are helping the user to scan the page and find the information they are looking for. In tools and transactions, it’s unlikely you will have a lot of information to break up but if you do, use subheads. The only way you will know if your service works, is to test it with users. Then modify and test it again. GOV.UK is to open up government information and services to anyone who is interested or needs to interact with government. As government we need to be inclusive - we can do this through our design and language. By making the design open and easy to read, the code clean and accessible and the words easy to understand, we are opening up government to all. Citizens of the UK can’t go to anyone else for many of our services. Or if they do, to get a better, clearer experience, they usually have to pay for it. If we make the information hard to read or the design so distracting or difficult that the user doesn’t understand what we are trying to say - they could end up doing it incorrectly or not doing it at all. This could lead to a fine. Or in very extreme cases, jail. Good design and words isn’t a desire or an ‘aim’ - it is our responsibility. The terms and conditions of your service must be understandable to the majority of users. GOV.UK’s terms and conditions were written to conform both the legal terms defined by the Treasury Solicitors Department (TSol) and to the style guide of GOV.UK. These form a template for other services to use, and cover many of the conditions that operational services published as part of GOV.UK will require. If your service needs additional terms or conditions added to this list then these should be written clearly, in a way that most users will be able to understand. In practise, this means unpicking lots of the legal language and giving users concrete examples to help them understand what a specific term or condition means. Adding that term or condition should be done in consultation with GDS. Directgov proved to be a good model for this, as their terms and conditions were clearly written and easy to understand. GOV.UK continued this, with additional pieces of information added as transactions and services were incorporated into the site.","description":"This section gives details on naming your service, tone, style, questions and why we write in this way.","link":"/service-manual/design-and-content/writing-government-services.html"},{"title":"Assessments before April 2014","indexable_content":"you require spend approval to move on to the next phase of a build. you want to go live on a service.gov.uk sub domain or just want to test how the service measures up against the standard before moving on to the next phase of development does the service meet user needs? can it be rapidly improved? is it safe, ie are appropriate security and privacy protections in place?

Before then, GDS is using the standard to support the Cabinet Office controls, in order to deepen knowledge of the standard across government, and identify areas where we can support departments in building capability. GDS will not expect any services to fully meet the standard before they receive spending or domain approval before April 2014. Assessments against the standard over 13/14 will be used to help to highlight areas of improvement for services, and identify systemic problems.

Meeting (and keeping) the standard isn’t simply a ‘one size fits all’ exercise. All services within the scope of the standard will be assessed against the criteria of the standard. A team’s service manager will present a public beta of the service alongside content from the service’s public blog to a go live panel including experts from within and outside government. The service manager will have to demonstrate that the service and team have consistently met the criteria in the standard to the unanimous satisfaction of the panel. The panel will apply common sense and a degree of flexibility to their assessments, giving teams feedback and guidance about how to improve a service when it looks like they will not meet the standard. The department or agency that owns the service is formally responsible for ensuring it achieves and maintains the standard, irrespective of whether it is designed, built and operated by in-house, external or mixed teams. Having high quality, regularly updated and publicly available information about how services are being built is really important. It not only demonstrates commitment to meeting the standard, but also: A public blog is the best way of collecting and publishing this information. Publishing this information means that people from across (and outside of) government can follow the progress of a service, allowing teams to quickly get advice and test their assumptions with a wider community. It also means that there is published audit trail of progress that can be used to support the decisions of the panel. While there are no fixed deadlines for meeting the standard, we expect that redesign or transformation of a service should take 18-24 months. As a result, having feedback throughout the process is really important, reducing the risk of lengthy projects going off-track. To enable this, and support an agile approach to design, progress against the standard will be monitored as part of existing spending control processes. Departments currently need Cabinet Office approval for digital spending. To simplify this process, a dedicated account manager will work with each department in order to help prioritise their projects. When a department makes a submission to their account manager for spending approval on services that fall within the scope of the standard, GDS will assess whether the work completed so far is in line with it.  If the service redesign or build process is at an early stage, GDS will make meeting the standard a condition of approval.  If the service redesign or build process is at a more advanced stage, GDS will make recommendations for additional spending on the basis of the evidence available for a service being on track to meet the standard. This evidence will be taken from the team’s public blog. GDS will also explicitly state when the team should return for further approval. A team will go through this process more than once to unlock spending approval for each phase of a service, supporting an iterative approach to service design. Rather than increasing the volume of paperwork the public blog will be used for evidence of progress, and will also help GDS to provide departments with targeted support and feedback on whether they are on track to meet the standard far in advance of a go live panel.","description":"Meeting (and keeping) the standard isn’t simply a ‘one size fits all’ exercise.

That audience includes users who access the service via a range of assistive technologies, such as screen readers, voice recognition software, trackball devices and so on. It’s important to consider a range of disabilities when you are testing any product or service, including those with; The Equality Act 2010 came into force in 2010 and is intended to tackle discrimination against members of society who may be unfairly treated due to age, disability, race, religion or sexual orientation. We have a duty to make adjustments for disabled persons so that we do not exclude them from the services we provide and must make every reasonable attempt to ensure access. The RNIB has a useful guide to the UK law and how it affects the accessibility of your site or service. Most accessibility testing is typically conducted after an accessibility audit has been conducted. Accessibility testing with participants with a range of needs is best conducted in the participants’ own homes. This is because they will often have things set up to suit their individual needs and the whole process is less stressful for them eg travel, environment. It is often difficult to conduct accessibility testing early on in the process of service design. The service must be fairly robust in order for it to be evaluated by people using assistive technologies eg a screen reader will read out the contents of a web page so the code needs to be well structured.  For accessibility testing to be worth doing, real content needs to be in place rather than ‘dummy text’ if it is to be assessed by those with any cognitive or learning difficulties. Interactive elements such as Calls To Action, hyperlinks, forms etc must be in place if motor skills are being assessed. Full lab-based accessibility testing is not necessary for every project. An accessibility audit may be a more efficient and cost-effective way to review a service, depending on its typical user needs. Accessibility audits are an alternative to standard accessibility testing. An accessibility audit involves an accessibility expert reviewing the site or service, highlighting all accessibility issues and making recommendations for fixing them.  They would typically use assistive software used by disabled web users (eg a screen reader) to effectively carry out the audit. See the W3C accessibility guidelines for further information. Accessibility audits are cheaper and quicker than accessibility testing but rely primarily on the expertise of the person conducting them. Disabled participants should be included as part of a wider user testing recruitment process. The numbers will be small, but should aim to capture a range of disabilities and assistive technologies. This is a harder to reach audience so the cost of doing so can be relatively expensive. Recruitment is best conducted through specialist organisations or agencies eg RNIB, etc Additional costs can be incurred if these participants are travelling to your testing location and/or require specialist assistance with carers or travel. Recruitment via an agency can take up to 2 weeks, depending on the target audience. Conducting testing sessions can take between 2-3 days depending on the number of participants.

Conversion Funnels What is a Conversion Funnel? Blog article by Morgan Brown with a good discussion on user flows and conversion funnels There are various web analytics tools available to help you measure how people are using your service. You will need to assess how well a particular tool meets your needs before deciding which one to use. This guidance describes some of the criteria you should consider and reviews some of the main analytics tools against them. When deciding which analytics tool is most appropriate for your service, you should consider the following: For each of these criteria, you should identify which are fulfilled as part of the standard quoted package and what is charged for any additional features. The privacy and security of data is of the utmost importance. Make sure your analytics solution and processes take the following into account: There are a range of digital/web analytics vendors in the market-place, together with open source solutions. A search for Analytics Tools Comparison provides a number of useful resources where you can compare the capabilities and strengths of different services. (See some examples in Further reading below). Install and configure analytics tools that meet your needs. Where possible, use platforms that enable the data to be piped automatically into other systems. Using APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) will stop you having to input data manually and allows for aggregation across multiple platforms. You will need to answer the following: A selection of sites that provide vendor comparison information: For information on digital analytics: For transactions, it’s important to understand funnels:","description":"There are various web analytics tools available to help you measure how people are using your service.

Eschew changes to the semantics of content, eg don’t change a title field from meaning the title of the page, to the meaning the prefix for a name to the person’s job title. The API Craft Group is a reasonably active public forum for discussing publishing APIs. The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) maintains a large repository of security information applicable to building APIs, a including a REST Security Cheat Sheet. The WhiteHouse are developing API standards which are largely compatible with this guide. Martha Lane Fox’s report called for government to act as a “wholesaler, as well as the retail shop front, for services and content by mandating the development and opening up of Application Programme Interfaces (APIs) to third parties.”  This section is a set of guiding principles for exposing a digital service as an API. When building an API there is always a danger of building the wrong thing in the wrong way for the wrong people. This is especially a risk in the absence of a developer community driving the needs behind the API. The simplest way to ensure your API is useful and consumable is to build a website using your own API. Building a Website leads to considering how to best model content and data in terms of bookmarkable resources, and ensures data is presented in human as well as machine readable representations.  Becoming a consumer of your own APIs not only validates your API, but exposes services on The Web. Consider an API to be a part of a Website. Provide links to machine-friendly formats from human readable pages, and enable agents to easily construct URLs which link to human-friendly representations of pages. Use standard formats for content, and follow established Web patterns for authentication. Building a service to enjoy mass adoption and support from a wide disparate community of developers and programming environments whilst being able to reach a world-wide audience is difficult. Whilst proprietary and open technologies abound for machine-to-machine communication, none combine the interoperability, reach and ability to scale to compete with The Web. Standards are powerful agreements, and nowhere are agreements more quickly established and adopted than on The Web. Using HTTP and URIs, the core technologies of The Web, together with emergent standards such as JSON and OAuth changes a Website from a retail shop window into a wholesaler, meeting our design principle to Build digital services, not websites. Expose data as a set of resources, offering a clean URL for each thing, and each collection of things. Only use query strings for URLs with unordered parameters, such as options to search pages. Consider creating URIs for different granularity of resources. For example, /members.json could return a list of names, whilst /members.json?detail=full could return detailed information about each member in a list. These principles enable network effects which arise through linking and allow information published beyond the Web, sent in alerts email, SMS, XMPP and other messages to link back to the canonical content, on The Web. Ensure all HTTP GET requests are safe, and actions which change state are conducted using a POST, PUT or DELETE method. Use PUT and DELETE with caution, as they are commonly blocked by firewalls, intranet proxies, hotel Wifi and mobile operators; always offer a POST alternative. Avoid HTTP methods which are not well defined, such as PATCH. Offer content for each thing as a human-readable HTML, with links to content in alternative machine-readable representations: Where possible, also offer other formats most suited to a specific domain, such as: This advice builds on our more general guidance on data and content publication formats. Include hyperlinks to alternative representations as link headers as well as in content. Consider also encoding meta-data inside HTML content using semantic markup: Microformats. RDFa or schema.org. The representations supported by an API for input will vary depending upon the complexity of the action, but where possible should include application/x-www-form-urlencoded to allow the construction of simple POST forms. Use names for fields, formats and path segments in a URI path consistently across your API. Establish conventions others may easily follow, and anticipate. Where possible, reuse names widely used elsewhere on The Web, as with the Microformats naming policy. Building a Website which exposes the data through links, and services through HTML forms encourages exploration and leads to discovery through hypertext. Provide documentation for your API using examples. Collect how people are using your API, especially link to any open source projects for projects, wrappers and programming language libraries. Provide simple ways to experiment, as with The Guardian API explorer. Be clear in Web pages and other documentation as to the security, availability, rate-limiting, expected responsiveness of the platform and the provenance of data, so consumers may plan their commitment to using your API. Lower the barriers to others using your data; don’t demand registration or API keys for public data. Open data increases the number of people able to use your data and service, and leads to feedback loops where consumers become motivated to resolve issues at source, feeding back issues and correction to your service and the data within. Where content is sensitive, or requires authentication, use encryption (HTTPS) and a standard authentication such as Basic Authentication or OAuth, depending upon the sensitivity of your content. Where a revolutionary change is unavoidable, communicate a breaking change by changing the URL. When changing URIs, continue to honour old consumers, possibly use a redirection. Cool URIs don’t change. Don’t do everything yourself (you can’t). Sometimes the functionality your service needs will be provided by other parts of your organisation, other government departments or by reliable third parties via APIs. Most modern digital services are built on top of a wide range of APIs. This allows each part of the service to focus on its core responsibility rather than constantly reinventing the wheel. When consuming APIs you should be careful to keep the integration with your code clean and distinct. This is important to ensure that you can swap between providers or update to new versions of an API without making substantial changes to your core code.  At GDS we encourage the use of adapter code that is entirely focussed on interfacing with the system and mapping code that will provide the linkage between your code’s domain model and the concepts and services provided by the API. You should consider carefully how you intend to test your integration with the service. In day to day development you will want to be able to test your code without making (computationally or potentially financially) costly calls out to third party services so you should come up with a way of providing mock versions of those APIs. For full system tests, however, you will want to test the full flow including the third-party service so an automated mechanism should be built for that. Many of the GOV.UK publishing applications send emails to provide alerts for content designers. When running tests we don’t want to send lots of fake emails so we swap the normal email adapter for one that logs the emails it would have sent. This lets us test our code is doing the right thing without depending on external services. Our ‘data insights’ code involves significant interactions with Google Analytics. It wouldn’t be practical to test this by sending events to Google, waiting for them to be processed, and then reviewing the results. Our developers therefore built a mock service that can be run alongside tests and provides a dummy version of Google’s API that lets us check the right data is being sent. Our publishing systems make use of a single sign-on service. In most of our tests the interaction with that service are mocked so the applications’ tests can be run in isolation, but we also have a suite of smoke tests that run in our preview environment and use dummy accounts to ensure that the full authentication and authorisation flow is working. The Licence Application Tool integrates with a number of third-party payment services. It makes use of test accounts with those services to verify it is able to communicate with them and is sending the right data to complete payments. By depending on a third party API you could very easily be tying your service’s availability to that of the third party. In some cases that may be acceptable, but often you will want to ensure that you have a fallback plan in place. The details of that fallback will vary according to your service. It may be that you will need to offer the user the opportunity to use an alternative service, or queue the action to take place later. That could be an automated queue with software that monitors it and retries transactions, or it could be a manual queue where someone follows up to collect further details. You should be clear with your users about what is happening. If a third party payment provider isn’t available you might queue the transaction to try again later. That will mean you can’t offer users the same guarantee that their payment will be processed correctly and you should tell them so.","description":"Martha Lane Fox’s report called for government to act as a “wholesaler, as well as the retail shop front, for services and content by mandating the development and opening up of Application Programme Interfaces (APIs) to third parties.” ","link":"/service-manual/making-software/apis.html"},{"title":"Choosing technology","indexable_content":"You can change your mind Start with capabilities, not implementations Cost Consider people Testing and deployment Lock-in When to make new software versus using existing software Level playing field Coding in the open Why we do this Further reading Reasons not to share software maximise developer productivity minimise total cost of ownership avoid lock-in make it easy for the government to share software that it creates    Please note, this is for guidance purposes only, and should not be taken as legal advice.     In some cases you might want to store the ‘master’ version of your software on an internal source code control system and replicate the latest version to a public repository.     You should ensure that any decision you make to use existing software, whether open source or proprietary, doesn’t stop you from sharing any new software that you create (or your suppliers create for you) under a permissive, GPL-compatible open source licence.     Keys, passwords and other secrets must always be stored safely and securely away from source code following Kerckhoffs’ principle. This separation of project code from deployed instances of a project is good development practice regardless of whether or not the software itself is shared in public.     For projects with a high impact level, particularly with a small number of participating developers, it is advisable to have a private space to discuss security issues and develop a patch rather than risk flagging a vulnerability before a fix has been deployed.  At different points in your project you’ll have to choose one technology over others. That might be a programming language, database, library, operating system or some small tool that helps the development team work more efficiently. In some cases you may also have to choose between proprietary and open source software. Please note, this is for guidance purposes only, and should not be taken as legal advice. The most important consideration is to work on the assumption that most of your technology choices can change, especially during the early stages of development. You might select a programming language that you know to be easier and quicker to prototype in for the early stages of the project, and then move to another one that is easier for large teams to use for the final product. Or you might start out with an open source product to allow you to get started quickly, before going on to buy a commercial (proprietary) product which provides some required feature (or vice-versa). On day one of your project you simply won’t know enough about the domain or the user need to select the right technology. It’s OK to make an educated guess at this stage, as long as everyone understands that is what is happening. Then find time to challenge the selection as you learn more about the problem at hand. It’s very easy to immediately jump to a specific product when making technology choices. This tends to be based either on past experience or on fashion. Try and take a step back and think about the capabilities of the technology you’re after. Are you looking for a relational database? Or a document database? A key/value store? Or maybe a graph database? Argue first about the capabilities, rather than any specific implementation. Once you have defined a set of capabilities, work out how you will test solutions against those capabilities. You should aim to test any software that appears appropriate in an environment that is very similar to your production environment, ie at production scale under real-world conditions (including worst-case user load). This will allow you to make sure you understand its specific characteristics, confirm that that its claimed capabilities are genuine, and identify any trade-offs or potential issues to consider with a given piece of software such as conceptual fit with your domain model vs. performance under heavy load. When choosing technology make sure you consider the total cost, as well as any upfront fees. Try and take into consideration costs for things like staff, support or licensing costs (where applicable), the productivity of ongoing service improvement work, and any exit costs (especially around migration of data to a future replacement system) that might be caused by the use of non-open standard formats or protocol extensions. Ensure that you understand the cost implications of any unusually high user loads in production systems. Try and involve the whole team in technology choices. That doesn’t mean no-one owns the decision making but that you want the development team (including web ops people) to share their insights into the options available and how they will affect the overall system, and thereby get their ‘buy in’ to the technology choices made. Technology preferences vary, and technology choice can divide opinion. All things being equal, picking technologies that developers and operations staff like will typically result in improved productivity. The services that we write will need to be deployed, early and frequently. Any components that we choose should be easy to deploy and upgrade as part of an automated pipeline. Frequent, automated testing is essential in agile development. Software that makes testing difficult should be avoided. Technology lock-in happens when previous decisions regarding technology limit future decisions, possibly so that only one real choice exists. For example, if you select a database that only runs on one operating system you have no choice about the operating system you will use. If the costs of that operating system jump you have no simple way of reducing that cost quickly or cheaply. Over time, and after many decisions, you can find yourself in a situation where all your technology decisions are tightly coupled and you are locked-in to one vendor, or one way of doing things. This can have unforeseen financial costs (for example an overnight cost increase) and might also limit how quickly you can iterate on your product in the future (if, for instance, the ideal technology choice isn’t compatible with your current vendor or technology). Aim to have a clear understanding of the cost or implications of moving away from a technology when you commit to it, and avoid technology lock-in whenever possible. This may sometimes mean choosing not to use certain features of a particular piece of technology, such as non-standard extensions to protocols, APIs or programming languages, in order to avoid lock-in and preserve the ability to move to another technology at a later date. In general, you should avoid making long-term commitments to any particular technology, product or supplier until you fully understand the problem you’re trying to solve - and even then, you should ensure you maximise your future development options and avoid technology lock-in if at all possible. Where there is an existing software solution which solves your problem, you should certainly consider using it. You are more likely to use existing software than to make new software when you have a commodity need. You may even be facing a niche problem that’s peculiar to government which has already been solved by another part of the government - or indeed another government - and released as open source software.  Development tools, build tools, utility libraries, databases and monitoring tools are all examples of software where many projects will have the same need, and it makes little sense to reinvent the wheel. For software that serves a rare or niche need you are less likely to find a tool which serves and will continue to serve your needs. In this situation you will likely have to create new software. Software that is developed to meet the needs of the government - whether it’s developed by government employees, contractors or by a supplier - should be shared wherever possible under a permissive, GPL-compatible open source licence (eg MIT/X11 or 3-clause BSD) so that it can be widely used and improved. This allows the software to be used and improved by anyone in the world who has a similar need. It’s important that other governments in particular have the opportunity to reuse the software you’ve created, because everyone deserves to have digital services so good that people prefer to use them. For example GovSpeak and unicorn herder are small components which were developed as a part of GOV.UK. They are now used by several different organisations, and have received a number of public contributions. You should always share software that has been written by the government and/or its suppliers (this includes source code and documentation) unless doing so would: a) create an unacceptable risk to the security of our systems or processes that cannot be mitigated with reasonable efforts b) contravene existing contractual arrangements c) directly threaten our national security In practice, sharing usually means uploading the source code and documentation to a public source code repository, keeping it updated with subsequent changes that you make (or accept from other people), and putting in place appropriate information security assurance to reduce and mitigate the risk of an exploit appearing in publicly-viewable software. In some cases you might want to store the ‘master’ version of your software on an internal source code control system and replicate the latest version to a public repository. Sometimes it’s not possible to share software that was developed for the government by a third party because the third party retains ownership of the ‘intellectual property’ (IP) embodied in that software. Contracts that allow third parties to retain ownership of IP in software that’s been developed for the government, and/or that restrict the government’s ability to share this software under a permissive, GPL-compatible open source licence, should be avoided. On other occasions the team may take a risk-based decision not to share some of the software they have created, for instance to avoid exposing in public the details of a particular risk-assessment algorithm or process. It’s good engineering practice in any case to encapsulate software, and so often in this situation a large portion of the software for a given system or service can still be shared in public. The default assumption should be in favour of coding in the open and sharing software widely, but if you have serious concerns about sharing source code in public, then CESG can provide you with advice based on your specific situation. See also the joint Cabinet Office / CESG statement on Open Source Software and Security. With the growth of free/open source software, many high quality technology products (databases, operating systems, programming languages, development tools, etc) are freely available for government and its suppliers to use and improve. But a large market still exists for commercial software products, and the availability of open source software doesn’t automatically mean that you can’t choose a proprietary technology if it meets our needs. However, it remains the policy of the government that, where there is no significant overall cost difference between open and non-open source products that fulfil minimum and essential capabilities, open source will be selected on the basis of its inherent flexibility. For more information on how to ensure a level playing field between proprietary and open source software, please see the Open Source Procurement Toolkit and the section of this manual that covers use of open standards. You should ensure that any decision you make to use existing software, whether open source or proprietary, doesn’t stop you from sharing any new software that you create (or your suppliers create for you) under a permissive, GPL-compatible open source licence. A successful open source project will garner contributions from a large number of sources, both inside and outside of a single organisation. Allow developers time to review contributions, and answer issues and discussion raised by others using the software. Larger open source projects often evolve an extension model to enable others to continue to use the service in a variety of often unexpected and possibly undesirable ways whilst keeping the core project coherent under the editorship of a small, trusted group of committers. Ensure developers have the ability to install and experiment with open source software, have environments to easily publish prototype services on The Web, have convenient access to a wide variety of network connected devices for testing Web sites, and have unrestricted access to collaboration tools such as GitHub, Stack Overflow and IRC. Take every opportunity to contribute back to open source projects you use. Contributions may be in the form of source code, patches, bug reports, feature requests, sponsorship of developers and support staff, engaging in community discussion groups, and giving public attribution to projects. Cite the open source code you use, as in the GOV.UK colophon - you can read more about this approach on the GDS blog entry about coding in the open. Keys, passwords and other secrets must always be stored safely and securely away from source code following Kerckhoffs’ principle.

For projects with a high impact level, particularly with a small number of participating developers, it is advisable to have a private space to discuss security issues and develop a patch rather than risk flagging a vulnerability before a fix has been deployed. Choosing technology is important, but it’s probably not quite as important as you think. What is important are the users of that technology and being able to deliver quality at a sustainable pace and suitable cost.

We also add manual testing as an extra check where appropriate. Any code written for your service should have a suite of tests operating at two levels: Requires broad tests that run through high-level functionality end-to-end, making sure that the pieces of the system come together to provide the right service.  A developer should be able to describe the steps in any acceptance test to the product/service manager in a way that makes sense to them and matches how they expect the service to be used (or abused!) Focussed on the specific details of the code ensuring that each discrete unit of code does what is expected of it. They allow the developers to verify that complex calculations are performed correctly, to ensure that code handles bad input properly, and that optimisations to the code don’t break its behaviour. We aim to write a first set of tests at the start of working on a feature. An acceptance test that describes the end-to-end behaviour ensures that everyone involved understands the objective of a piece of work, and can demonstrate progress through the story at hand. Unit tests can then be written to understand the implementation of the code. Tests are often described as ‘happy path’ or ‘sad path’. Happy path tests verify that the system can be used as intended, while sad-path tests verify that it handles errors (whether bad input from a user, a vital API being unavailable, or some other issue) gracefully. We start with happy path tests and a few simple sad path tests and then add more sad path tests as our understanding of the code and its dependencies develops. Tests should also be written whenever a bug is discovered. A test to reproduce the bug should be written before it is fixed, allowing you to verify that the bug has been fixed and ensure that it isn’t reintroduced later. Developers are expected to run tests regularly, especially before sharing new code, they are verified as part of the code review process, and they are also run regularly in a shared continuous integration system to ensure the whole team has a chance to see how they’re performing.","description":"We use automated testing to ensure that our code does what is intended, to protect against mis-use of that code, and to provide assurance that iterating that code for better design or new features doesn’t break existing behaviour.

Even a simple application probably requires some configuration, to provide database credentials or a web service endpoint for instance. In order to build robust, scalable and portable systems this configuration data should be well managed. Configuration management tools help with documenting and maintaining the configuration and dependencies of a software system. Although this could be done using hand-made software, it’s common to use existing tools. Three examples of existing open source configuration management tools are CFEngine, Chef and Puppet. One approach to managing configuration is to describe the configuration and the software dependencies in code. This brings with it all the advantages of programming in general, including: Once described in code the infrastructure configuration is executed against the servers, networks and software in question. Moving software systems between providers can be difficult and time-consuming. Even with compatible providers and simpler procurement rules it’s possible to lock yourself in through technical inertia alone. Configuration management encourages a deep understanding of the configuration of the system and this can be used to move software easily between providers. A common problem in software systems is seen when code written by a development team works on their machine or a test environment but not on the production environment. A common cause of this is differences in configuration – different versions of software, different types of database or application server. This can be avoided by using the same tools for both development and production environments. Existing approaches to managing configuration are often manual, process heavy, slow and error prone. Ultimately people are bad at carrying out detailed monotonous tasks. And installing and configuring software across tens or hundreds of servers (if done by hand) is definitely monotonous. Even if this could be done to provide everything correctly configured on day 0, over time configuration drifts if not kept in check. One traditional approach to this problem is to make configuration changes hard, thereby limiting the number of them. When trying to build agile and flexible software systems rapid change is needed and manual processes break down.","description":"Your system is likely to be much larger than a single application, relying on other supporting infrastructure components.

A service that is already operational and able to onboard customers very quickly (typically within 5 working days). Both incoming and outgoing internet connectivity. This should also facilitate remote management. We should be able to remotely provision new machines ourselves to meet our needs as they arise, without the need to phone, fax or email anyone, and therefore require a self service method of provisioning virtual machines and storage. Support for 64 bit architectures and a range of virtual machine sizes at least up to 4 cores, 16GB RAM and 300GB disk. The flexibility to run whatever operating system is deemed suitable for the project, rather than just a limited subset of those supported by a vendor. We would prefer to store data in the EU, and ideally within the UK, therefore we require development environments to be hosted only in EU-based data centres. A suitable SLA should be in place with the service provider (whether internal or external), with at least a 99.5% uptime guarantee. Approved development team members should have root access to manage virtual machines (eg to install & configure software). Optional capabilities which would make a marked difference to the production of the services. The provisioning of virtual machines, storage, load balancing, etc to be available via an API. Any API should have a suitable authentication mechanism in place, and should be accessible to development team members via the Internet (optionally through a VPN). To speed up provisioning we would like to be able to store virtual machine templates from which new machines can be launched. If available a managed firewall and/or load balancer service may be used. We require the ability to manage internal networks, each consisting of specific groups of virtual machines. This should allow for some virtual machines not to be internet accessible. We may choose to expose parts of the service via a Virtual Private Network. The infrastructure service should at a minimum not prevent this and may ideally provide a suitable managed service.","description":"As software developers, the environments we use every day matter greatly.

Business Impact Level Tables: Business Impact Level Tables.    Assurance is the broad set of activities involved in assessing and managing the risks associated with the system under development, while accreditation refers to a subset of the assurance work, involving a formal and independently verified process similar to ISO27001.  When building your service, you will need to ensure that appropriate steps are taken to ensure its security. Information security is a topic both broad and deep, drawing from fields ranging from economics and psychology through to mathematics and probability, and this document cannot claim to provide a thorough review of the field. Instead, it aims to provide you with the briefest of introductions to information security, and will explain the communities and processes that exist to help you build world class secure services. The term information security refers to the theory and practice of defending data or information systems against unauthorized or unintended access, destruction, disruption or tampering. Security professionals frequently refer to three key concepts: In government, much is made of these three “key concepts of information security,” as will be explained below. Security systems typically attempt to address one or more of these concerns through: Not every system requires a full battery of security controls. Indeed, ‘completely secure systems’ do not exist, and overly secure systems are often prohibitively expensive or thoroughly inconvenient for their users. You should aim to build services that are appropriately secure, and in practice you will be guided by an assessment of the risks associated with a lapse in the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of your service. Within government, there is an established set of assurance and accreditation processes. These provide a structure and a shared language within which to discuss, analyse and address security considerations. If the processes work correctly, managers should have a clear and accurate understanding of what risks they are accepting, and those delivering the service should know what controls they are going to employ to mitigate those risks. Assurance is the broad set of activities involved in assessing and managing the risks associated with the system under development, while accreditation refers to a subset of the assurance work, involving a formal and independently verified process similar to ISO27001. The important thing to note about building trustworthy and secure systems is that it is a team game. Assurance and accreditation should not be a completely separate strand of work, or be seen as a hurdle to be jumped over (or sidestepped). Only by engaging with risk and making decisions based on a range of expert opinion will you end up with the best product. The rest of this document will introduce you to assurance and accreditation in government. The content will use quite a lot of acronyms; unfortunately these are in common usage and it’s very hard to engage with the existing documentation and processes without speaking the lingo. We include them here in the hope that they will provide a helpful reference which can be used when reading existing documentation. It’s important to understand the different roles involved within the process detailed below. One of the first things you should do on your project is to establish who plays each of these roles. Note that all of them require formal training and specialist skills. All projects, however small, should involve some level of assurance. This may be as simple as documenting the limited risks and proposing to the SIRO that the project does not require a formal accreditation. For anything involving sensitive data or of interest to lots of people an accreditation stage will be required, and this process is likely to include representatives from all of the above groups. Business Impact Levels, often shorted to Impact Levels (IL) are a set of numbers used to guide discussions of risk in Government projects. Specifically they are numbers between 0 and 6 for each of the three key concepts mentioned above, and measure: More details about identifying these numbers can be found in this extract from HMG IA Standard No. 1. The role-holders listed above will work with the wider team to bring the appropriate concerns to bear in the process of designing the service. The team as a whole will need to make a range of decisions about topics such as what information needs to be captured, how it is processed, whether it is stored, and so on which will have a direct impact on the assurance/accreditation process. A close working relationship will be essential to ensure that business impact levels and other details are kept up to date as designs evolve and that risk management plays an appropriate role as a constraint in the design process. The Good Practice Guides (GPG) are documents published by CESG on specific topics of interest to various types of projects. These can act as a good starting point when looking to identify risks and put in place mitigations. Unfortunately many of these documents are Restricted. It is advisable to establish a working relationship with CESG early on in the project to make sure you can access these documents. Examples include: The Risk Management Document Set or RMADS are the result of the formal accreditation work. This is likely a large set of documents, including the Baseline Control Set (BCS), system overview and supporting evidence, presented to the SIRO for sign-off as part of go-live conversations. The IT Health Check (ITHC) forms part of the formal Accreditation. In essence it is a penetration test carried out by a CESG approved supplier (specifically a CHECK certified individual). Read the guide about penetration and vulnerability testing for more details. The assurance and accreditation work described above is not just about getting a project to launch. It also covers the running of the resulting service. Over time, new threats may emerge, systems and processes may change, and assumptions may become invalid. Documentation should be kept up-to-date and additional penetration tests organised on a regular or as-needed basis. It is important to start understanding risks and engaging with the assurance and accreditation process as early in a project as possible. The following is a good starting place for milestones to add to a project plan: It’s important to understand the assurance and accreditation processes and tools are all about managing the risk associated with the running service. Security is part of this, but just one part. Nearly everything brings with it risks: technology choice, staffing, processes, access to restricted documents, data aggregation, etc. It is important to understand those risks and put in place sensible and suitable mitigations. It is unrealistic in most cases to aim for a system with no risks, and ignoring them is a recipe for future exploits. The aim is a system where the risks are known and the team, working with risk professionals, have made careful decisions about how to deal with them.","description":"When building your service, you will need to ensure that appropriate steps are\ntaken to ensure its security.

Building a login system is a significant undertaking. While there are numerous open source libraries that make it trivial to add login functionality to your service, the moment you add that feature you’re significantly increasing your user support overhead (people forget how to sign in, lose their passwords, etc), you’re accruing personal data that you will need to constantly review and protect, and you’re adding a relatively complex interaction for users to complete. Many features that are often implemented using login systems can be completed in other (and potentially more useful) ways. Saving search results, for example, doesn’t require a login but just a way of helping users remember a specific URL. Instead of having them log in you could provide a tool to help send the URL to an email address or instructions on creating a bookmark in their browser. Or perhaps you could just take their email address and let them know if the search results change? The precise details will vary according to what users need from your service, but if there’s an alternative to a login system that should be preferred. If after careful review and design work there is no option but to build a login system you will need to consider a few questions: If building a service for a small number of clearly identified agents then it is probably safe to proceed. You should ensure that any authentication and authorisation code written for your system is carefully separated from the application in such a way that you can: If you need to build a system for a broad range of citizens and businesses, or you need to do sophisticated matching with other systems in order to build trust in the identity of your users then you should explore the advice published by the ID Assurance team. The ELMS license application system on Business Link required a login to complete an application. In building a new version of the system for GOV.UK we removed that requirement and usage rates have increased considerably. There is still a login system for approved users in local authorities who need to process those applications.","description":"Our advice is that teams do not build login systems.","link":"/service-manual/making-software/logins.html"},{"title":"Open standards and licensing","indexable_content":"What is an open standard?

Open Standards Principles Open Standards: Open Opportunities consultation outcome    Please note, this is for guidance purposes only, and should not be taken as legal advice.  Considerations for using open standards and why they matter. Please note, this is for guidance purposes only, and should not be taken as legal advice. We define open standards for software interoperability, data and document formats, as those which demonstrate all of the following criteria: Collaboration - the standard is maintained through a collaborative decision-making process that is consensus based and independent of any individual supplier. Involvement in the development and maintenance of the standard is accessible to all interested parties. Transparency - the decision-making process is transparent and a publicly accessible review by subject matter experts is part of the process. Due process - the standard is adopted by a specification or standardisation organisation, or a forum or consortium with a feedback and ratification process to ensure quality. Fair access - the standard is published, thoroughly documented and publicly available at zero or low cost. Market support - other than in the context of creating innovative solutions, the standard is mature, supported by the market and demonstrates platform, application and vendor independence. Rights - rights are essential to implementation of the standard, and for interfacing with other implementations which have adopted that same standard, are licensed on a royalty free basis that is compatible with both open source and proprietary licensed solutions. These rights should be irrevocable unless there is a breach of licence conditions. There are 7 open standards principles that you should follow when thinking about which open standards to use: We describe the reasons for these principles and their implications in the Open Standards Principles, published in November 2012. The Open Standards Board will be selecting some compulsory open standards using the Standards Hub process. Where these standards have been identified you should use them. If you are looking for an open standard and we’ve not set a compulsory one in that space, you should carry out a thorough assessment of the existing standards and choose a standard that meets your needs and is consistent with our definition. You should also consider how the standard fits with: If you are considering use of a standard that doesn’t meet our definition of an open standard, you’ll need to apply for an exemption. You’ll also need to apply for an exemption if you want to use an alternative standard to one that performs the same function if we’ve already selected compulsory standards for that purpose. By implementing open standards for software interoperability, data and document formats, we are: Build component-based digital services, based on open standards, to provide a flexible design to give you greater choice and enable your digital services to evolve. Expressing your user needs in terms of required capabilities, which are in turn based on open standards, helps you to make better choices for service delivery. It also means that there is no unintentional lock-in built into government digital services. Whether designing and building in-house or outsourcing, you must require solutions that comply with open standards, for software interoperability, data and document formats, where they exist and meet functional needs. If there is a reason why you think using open standards is inappropriate, on an exceptional case-by-case basis an exemption may be agreed in advance by the Government’s Chief Technology Officer (or through Departmental Accounting Officer procedures for cases below the Cabinet Office’s spend controls threshold for IT).","description":"Considerations for using open standards and why they matter.","link":"/service-manual/making-software/open-standards-and-licensing.html"},{"title":"Progressive enhancement","indexable_content":"First, just make it work Second, make it work better It isn’t about “JavaScript off” It isn’t only about JavaScript Further reading Progressive enhancement on Wikipedia Understanding progressive enhancement on A List Apart For a Future-Friendly Web on A List Apart Cutting the mustard on the BBC News responsive design blog When creating web pages, the only part of it that you can rely upon working is the HTML (and even that can fail, but without it there is no web page and everything else becomes moot). The attitude towards building for the web with this in mind is called progressive enhancement. Briefly, each extra layer (images, styling, behaviour, video, audio) of the page should be seen as optional. If you build pages with the idea that parts other than HTML are optional, you will create a better and more robust web page. Any new page or feature should first be made to work with HTML only. No images, no CSS, no JavaScript, nothing but HTML. Interactive elements are only those capable of being implemented with forms and server-side processing. This gives a baseline experience which will work in practically every browser, allowing your site to work for as many people and devices as possible, including older, legacy browsers and devices. From this baseline, the extra layers can be added. The page can have images added, advanced styling can be applied. Interactions can be made smoother and faster without the need to refresh the entire page. Validation of submitted data can be performed before it hits the network. Charts and data tables can be turned into visualisations with interactive elements. However, it is important that each addition is seen as just that — an addition. Something extra that the more modern browsers are capable of delivering on top of an already accessible and usable experience with as much of the content and interactivity as possible available already. A common misunderstanding is that designing sites to work without CSS, JavaScript or anything else is that this is not about a conscious choice made by the person visiting the web page that we can ignore, or treat as an error or mistake, and it isn’t a case of “just fix your browser”. There are many scenarios where the extra layers can fail to load, including temporary network errors and DNS lookup failures. The server that the resource is found on could be overloaded or down, and fail to respond in time or at all. On top of failures there is deliberate filtering of the Internet. Many large institutions (eg banks and financial institutions, some government departments) have corporate firewalls that block, remove or alter content from the Internet. Mobile network providers have been known to resample images and otherwise alter content in order to make the load times faster and reduce bandwidth consumed. Also some antivirus and personal firewall software will alter and/or block content. And, of course, there are people who do turn off features in their browsers deliberately. We should respect their decision and still provide them with a usable and useful service. Another common misunderstanding is that progressive enhancement is only about JavaScript. Anything more than HTML is an enhancement and should be treated as such. Adding an image to a page requires suitable alternative text (and may also need a longer description) for people with visual impairment, and simply for when the image fails to load. Styling cannot be the only method by which information is shared. “Text in bold” is not enough when you can’t differentiate bold from normal text. “Red items are required” is not enough when you don’t have the colours applied, cannot see the colours or cannot distinguish them because of colour blindness. Video and audio without transcripts and/or subtitles are unsuitable for hearing impaired people. Information appearing in a video in a visual-only form (eg a question then answered by the people on screen in an interview) is unsuitable for people with visual impairments. Making an interactive element that requires a mouse (eg a hover effect, a drag and drop operation) is unusable by someone who only uses a keyboard or a touch-only device such as a smartphone or tablet.","description":"When creating web pages, the only part of it that you can rely upon working is the HTML (and even that can fail, but without it there is no web page and everything else becomes moot).

How often you want to do this will affect how you design and build the applications and presents a number of challenges that this guide hopes to address. It is important to think about how you release changes to a running application as early in the products development as possible. This is because it affects how software is developed and tested and how a product may be supported. Being able to release software on demand is important. 6 monthly or longer release cycles are dangerous. Not only do new features rarely see the light of day but fixing known problems have to fit within a rigid release schedule.  Note that it’s important to make the distinction between releasing regularly and the ability to release all the time. The application should always be in a state where it could be released, that means quick changes can be made when needed. As an example changes to the software running GOV.UK are made on average 5 times per day. In order to do that you have to consider: Although tools, potentially including commercial tools, are required to aid rapid releases the discussions should not start with what tools should be used or procured but with the needs of the service and the product team. In some organisations, people fear releasing new applications or new versions of software. Lots of websites, especially large applications within large traditional organisations, don’t change very often. Many will have fixed release schedules which might mean one release every six months or so. This means bundling up lots of changes into a single release, which is bad in at least two ways: It could be weeks or months before an improvement that only took a few days to finish is actually released for people to use, and the complexity means there are lots of different ways the release can go wrong. The combination of complexity, risk and the infrequent nature of releases makes for a stressful event for all involved. No wonder most people don’t like release day! Releasing software comes with risks, so trying to minimise those risks is prudent. We do that in a number of ways: As well as reducing risk, being able to release early and often also helps products improve quickly, by reducing a potential barrier to quick experiments and rapid iteration. Finally consider the following two measures of a system; mean time between failures and mean time to recovery. A very traditional approach involves focusing completely on reducing the time between any failures happening, by hopefully improving the quality of the overall system. But problems will always happen at some point, so focusing some effort on reducing the time taken to fix problems that do occur can often be much more cost effective as well as improve the overall system uptime.","description":"Constantly improving online services means releasing changes to the underlying software.

Those working hands-on building the software for the service should be able to run their own reasonable replica of the entire service.  There should be a clear staging environment where changes are reviewed and tested in the context of the entire end-to-end service before they are deployed. Everyone working on a service should be able to see progress and understand their work in its full context. That means a shared environment where any team member can see the current state of the service and where stories can be signed off, and individual sandboxes where more experimental or early stage work can take place and be reviewed. In addition to those environments it can be helpful to have a separate staging environment where final quality assurance and testing can take place before changes are deployed to the live/production environment. This should be identical to the production environment so it can be used effectively for performance testing. For those working on GOV.UK we use the Vagrant tool to provide all developers with a development environment configured similarly to the production environment.  We then have a preview environment that is updated by our Continuous Integration system whenever tests have passed on a change. There is then a staging environment for review of specific changes before they go to the production environment.

If so, please provide supporting evidence, eg analytics data that shows proportion of visitors to your content/service that currently access it using relevant devices Government approach to apps presentation Tom Loosemoore’s blog post about standalone apps    “Stand-alone mobile apps will only be considered once the core web service works well on mobile devices, and if specifically agreed with the Cabinet Office”     NOTE: If these conditions are not in place, it is unlikely that your app proposal will be approved. If you believe there are compelling reasons why these conditions have not been met, please set them out in your proposal.  The government’s position is that native apps are currently rarely justified. At the October 2012 Digital Leaders’ meeting, the position was clarified: native apps could not be developed without Cabinet Office approval. The November 2012 Digital Strategy says: “Stand-alone mobile apps will only be considered once the core web service works well on mobile devices, and if specifically agreed with the Cabinet Office” Ensuring your service meets the Digital by Default Service Standard means it will work well on mobile devices. Making your data and API available for reuse will stimulate the market if there is real demand for native apps. So-called ‘apps’ come in several different flavours, therefore confusion is understandable. When people are talking about ‘apps’, they can mean device-specific ‘download and install’ apps (aka native apps) or websites that respond to various screen sizes (aka responsive websites, web apps or HTML5) or even various hybrids of the two. Native apps are downloadable software applications that run using the device’s operating system code and APIs. They persist on the device and can access all the hardware features (camera, storage, phone capabilities, etc). Because they run using native code, different versions must be created for each operating system. Examples of native apps include Spotify, Angry Birds, Instagram and Skype. Responsive web design is a design approach that optimises users’ viewing experiences across a wide range of devices. When a responsive website is accessed via a mobile phone, it is sometimes referred to as a ‘mobile web app’. Responsive websites are built using open web standards (HTML, CSS, javascript, etc) and they run inside a device’s web browser. Examples are GOV.UK, PM’s dashboard, FT webapp, BBC Sport. If there is a market for native apps, why should the government monopolise it? There is a vibrant market of 3rd party native app developers using government data and APIs. Government’s position is that native and hybrid apps currently rarely justified. We are backing open standards rather than risking proliferation of parallel versions of services as devices proliferate. And while people spend as much time using apps as using mobile web the vast majority of app use is for gaming and social networking. For ‘utility’ needs, such as those met by government services, the mobile web is preferred to native apps We recognise that there’ll be a few exceptions. To help you assess whether your case is likely to be considered an exception, consider the following: Condition 1: Your web service is already designed to be responsive Condition 2: The service or the content you’re looking to build an app for is already open to third-parties via APIs or as open data NOTE: If these conditions are not in place, it is unlikely that your app proposal will be approved. If you believe there are compelling reasons why these conditions have not been met, please set them out in your proposal. In addition to the evidence requested above, all digital spend for the development of standalone mobile apps is subject to the GDS spend approval.

It is important to recognise why you are testing in the first place: Too often the aim of testing is to validate what has been produced and nothing else. Your testing should be more about the following 7 concepts: Use the vast majority of your efforts building quality in at the start, and test the quality throughout the project - not at the end when it’s too late. Define acceptance criteria standards for your user stories. You can either do this when you first write your user stories or later on in the form of acceptance tests when you start development work. Testing should confirm what you already know and understand to be true, so there should be no surprises in the latter stages. Service quality isn’t just a testing issue. The quality of a system is defined by the people who create it.  Your team should be able to see a problem in the quality of your system. Every person on the project should be taking action to increase quality and fix issues. A successful agile project relies on fast feedback loops. Getting feedback and getting it fast means you can actually be agile and change when you need to change. Your testing should be about giving and getting that fast feedback - at a time when it’s useful. Agile test techniques (eg behaviour driven development, acceptance test driven development) have their place and you can use them, but don’t make them the centre of your approach to testing. When you build a test, build it to a standard that makes it suitable to use for testing multiple times throughout your project. It takes a lot of effort to do testing correctly, so don’t make it a throwaway exercise that has to start from scratch each time there’s a new release, or a new project. Write your automated tests with the same care and accuracy as production code. Testing is necessary and valuable to the programme, but the time it takes for your code to go live once written is time wasted. Use testing to get the fastest possible confirmation that everything is as you expect - or that it isn’t and needs to be fixed. It doesn’t always need to be exhaustive at every level, but it does need to be relevant to the current situation. Your team needs to agree on the necessary testing at each level, based on the preferences of the product owner and the likelihood of risk in the application itself. Everybody in your programme needs to understand and agree on: When done well, testing will inform you of the best way forward. It’ll also give you the best value in terms of effort used in various functional or nonfunctional areas and will: The most noticeable difference with testing in an agile project is that the majority of your test efforts will be centred on automated tests.  These tests run in continuous integration (C.I.), which means that they form part of your codebase - every time you make a change to your code, your tests are automatically run. You’ll get immediate feedback on the quality of your code and it’ll help to prevent bugs happening at a later stage (when they’re expensive and complicated to resolve.) Read the guidance about testing code.   Exploratory  testing is a term commonly used to describe unscripted manual testing. This is where the tester uses his or her knowledge, experience and intuition to go through through the software and identify bugs. The difference between unscripted and scripted tests is that a scripted test can only ever test a predetermined outcome. Exploratory testing (unscripted) doesn’t mean you don’t prepare for the testing. Exploratory testing is: The quality analysts or testers in your team carry out this type of testing. If your team is made up of only developers, you’ll need to put time aside for the developers to do the testing, but bear in mind that: When a manual test finds a defect, it’s important to always add an automated test to stop it from happening again. Read Cem Kaner on exploratory testing Read the guidance about load & performance testing Read the guidance about penetration testing Read the guidance about accessibility testing Crowdsourced testing doesn’t use a set group of people to carry out testing (known as outsource testing). It uses different people from different places in different jobs. It’s a good way of speeding up your manual testing and/or covering more ground. There are external companies who provide this as a service, but GDS do it internally by: Examples of where GDS used this effectively include: Don’t forget, don’t just test the product itself - test your ideas.

Version control allows you to track changes to code over time, meaning that you can quickly step back to an earlier version where necessary and you can annotate your changes with explanatory details to help future developers understand the process. Version control will also provide tools to audit who has made changes to the code and what has changed. Those updating the code should make small, discrete ‘commits’ of changes that are grouped according to their intention. They should be committed with a clear message explaining what the intention of the change was and (where appropriate) providing links to any supporting information such as development stories, bug reports, or third-party documentation. At GDS we prefer to use a distributed version control system. This means that everyone involved in the process has a full copy of the code and of its history. This makes it easier for developers to create ‘branches’ in their code to explore new features or approaches without treading on the toes of those working on different aspects of the service. We use Git, which is one of the highest profile options. It also provides extra resilience; if the network is unavailable the developers can continue to work and make small incremental commits, merging their changes back with everyone else’s at a later date. It’s a good idea to also use version control for other aspects of your work, not just code. We use the same version control tools to manage this document as we do our code, and the Government Digital Strategy was also produced that way.","description":"All software development projects must use a version control system.

This in turn leads to low levels of digital take-up and customer satisfaction, and a higher cost per transaction. Measuring end-to-end completion rates helps identify whether users have problems completing a transaction; subsequent analysis of drop-out rates at each step of a transaction can then pinpoint the specific processes that users fail to complete. The completion rate measures the proportion of people who start a transaction and are able to complete it. A transaction is a self-contained process that the service manager has defined in relation to the service. Typically this will be completing an entire transaction from end to end but where a transaction can be completed only partly online, it may be completing a discrete process within the transaction: booking an appointment or completing a part of an application, for example. The end-to-end completion rate can be calculated as the number of completed transactions divided by the number of started transactions; it is expressed as a percentage.  Users should be told clearly what the outcome of the transaction will be, who can use it, how long it is likely to take, and what they will need to complete it (eg a reference number or credit card) before the transaction has started. They will also need to be provided with the eligibility criteria and the costs to complete the transaction. This will help to reduce dropouts later in the transaction. Typically this information will be given on a single page. In some cases, there may be a set of pages that checks a user’s eligibility based on information they provide. It should not be possible to bypass start pages via links or search engine results. Users who try to access another transaction page directly should be referred back to the start page, unless they are resuming a previously saved transaction. Transactions will begin and end on GOV.UK to allow GDS to monitor completion rates.  A transaction is considered to have started only when the user proceeds from the start page. A user then has to reach the end page before the transaction is counted as complete.  Data on the number of started and completed transactions will be shared with service owners.  Service managers will be responsible for measuring and monitoring drop-out rates within transactions which are not hosted on GOV.UK. You should analyse this data and use it to improve your service. You should build your service with unique URLs for each step / page. This will make your service much easier to measure. Some services allow users to save a transaction mid flow and to resume it another time. Ideally it should be possible to match saved transactions with resumed transactions so that, for the purposes of completion rate, they are treated as one continuous process. Service managers could consider applying a nominal time limit to saved transactions after which, if they haven’t been resumed, they are classed as failed. Alternatively, saved transactions could be set to expire after a given length of time.                           Some services have complex flows and there may be several points at which a transaction can be successfully completed. These will need to be defined by service managers and should point to appropriate end pages on GOV.UK so they count towards the completed transaction total. Some transactional services have parts which are digital and others which are non-digital. For example, when granting a lasting power of attorney, users can start and finish the transaction online, but are required to print, sign and post a form in the middle of the process.  In these situations the second online part of the transaction should be treated as a resumption of the first part. Where it is not possible to match the two, the discrete digital parts of the service should be treated as separate tasks, with the measure completion rate measured for each.  Offline parts of the process can still be measured but this is likely to be done through qualitative feedback (eg from surveys, diary studies, focus groups). In order to successfully measure your service completion rate, we recommend that: Completion rate should be measured continuously. Once the service is live this will be done on GOV.UK. Before launch completion rates can be measured with usability testing. This should be iteratively tested with at least five people.  This should identify over 85% of usability problems. Users will be given a pre-determined set of tasks that reflect what needs to be done to use the service. These tasks will include all aspects of using the service that apply, such as registering, applying, submitting, verifying, amending and unsubscribing. If users are having difficulty completing tasks, further development should be followed by further rounds of testing. Digital analytics will be the primary method for measuring task completion rates post launch. Please note that this relies on extra configuration in the analytics tool. It will not be available by default. The focus of the service team’s activities will be to continually improve this by monitoring where users are dropping out of the transaction process and testing out new designs for those pages. End to end completion rates will be piped automatically from GOV.UK’s digital analytics into the Performance Platform. and will be publicly available from the point of launch. Further usability should also be carried out once a service have gone live to measure use of the service and identify any issues and improvements that can be made.

As services become more efficient, the cost per transaction will fall. Cost per transaction is a measure of the total cost to the government of providing each completed transaction. You will also want to measure the difference in the cost of the transaction through each available channel. Understanding these costs will help you to accurately forecast savings and build a strong business case for making services digital by default. The average cost per transaction is calculated as the total cost of providing the service divided by the total number of completed transactions. The total cost includes all fixed and variable costs of the transaction through a given channel, including overheads. It does not include start up costs. Where resources (eg call centres) are shared with other services, costs should be apportioned. For example, if half of all calls received relate to a specific service, then 50% of the call centre costs should be apportioned to that service. The cost per digital transaction is the total cost of providing the digital service divided by the total number of transactions completed digitally, including assisted digital transactions. Where processes and costs are common to more than one channel (eg processing wet signatures for passports, or printing driving licences), they should be apportioned. For example, if half of all transactions are completed digitally, then 50% of the common costs should be apportioned to the digital channel. The full cost of the transaction should include: The following should be excluded: Cost per transaction is measured on a quarterly basis. It should cover the last twelve months to eliminate seasonal fluctuations. Cost per transaction should be measured for the existing service - if there is one - to create a baseline against which future cost per transaction can be compared.

What level of digital take-up should I aim for? What about services for users who are more or less than 82% online? When should this level of take-up be achieved by? How should I increase digital take-up? What about assisted digital? Digital take-up is a long term strategic measure of how well digital by default service is working. You will monitor this on a monthly basis to track that it is on course with the desired performance trajectory. Digital take up is the proportion of people completing your transaction online, including Assisted Digital users. A digital transaction is one where the primary interaction between the user and the service has been through a digital user interface. Where it is possible to complete only part of a transaction online,  such transactions should still be classified as digital. Digital take up is calculated taking the number of completed digital transactions in a calendar month divided by the total number of transactions in the same month, expressed as a percentage. The total number of transactions will be made up of all non digital transactions including call centre transactions and paper based transactions. This data will need to be recorded and collected to ensure your digital take up figure is accurate. The Digital Landscape research found that 82% of adults in the UK are online. It therefore seems sensible to aim for something in that region. However, about a third of those online have never accessed government information or services online so this will involve a significant channel shift for most services. The extent to which people are online varies by age, gender and socio-economic status. The digital landscape research has a useful breakdown that should act as a guide. Digital take-up is a long term strategic measure and you should be looking to achieve the target level within five years of launch. Read guidance on ways of encouraging the use of digital by default services. Some users will never use the digital service but will still have to have access to the same level of service as those using the digital service. This is called assisted digital and departments will need to determine the appropriate mix of channels to support these users.

Have you mapped your metrics to the relevant audience? Have you identified where your metrics will be sourced from? Do you know how frequently performance information is required by your users? In addition to the four core KPIs (cost per transaction, user satisfaction, completion rate and digital take-up) it is recommended that you consider other useful KPIs specific to your service that will help you measure and improve its performance. Different sets of users within each department will typically have their own requirements for each service. A Service Manager will need to see a range of metrics that help them make decisions about the service on a daily basis. You will need to identify the various users within your organisation, and prioritise their requirements. Technical requirements might include improving response time or server resilience; financial requirements could include reducing costs or increasing revenue. There may be a customer service requirement to improve customer satisfaction, or wider strategic aims to reduce fraud and error. These needs will typically be reflected in the organisation’s business objectives or in the business case for transforming a service. An approach that worked well for the GOV.UK was to run a brainstorming session to generate a long list of metrics which we then narrowed down by asking senior managers, ‘if you had to choose one KPI, what would it be?’ Develop simple, actionable and collectable metrics based on your understanding of user and stakeholder needs. Identify where that information will come from and how frequently it will be needed. Think especially about the functions your service is relying on and try to identify some KPIs to ensure you are constantly monitoring and improving these functions. You might want to measure things like: It’s good practice to record every event generated by the system even if it’s not currently of interest. Measure everything (where it is cost-effective and practical to do so). This maximises the flexibility to come back later and revise the chosen metrics and tailor data visualisations to different audiences. The NAO report Digital Britain One: Shared infrastructure and services for government online identified that there was a lack of information on the costs and associated benefits of digital services.

Many government transactions are mandatory and therefore not inherently enjoyable - sometimes referred to as grudge transactions - but you should endeavour to make them as pleasant as possible for users, who may be nervous or stressed when interacting with the government. Asking users how satisfied they are with a service can provide a measure of all the elements contributing to the overall user experience such as ease of use, navigation and design. Defined as the percentage of people who answered either “very satisfied” nor “satisfied” on a five-point scale in response to the question: Q: Overall, how satisfied were you with this [eg car tax] service today? GOV.UK will provide a user satisfaction survey at the end of your transactional service and make this data available. You should measure all user journeys through your transaction to understand drop off points. If a user drops out your should try and collect some qualitative data to explain why they did not complete the transaction.

Promotion: can greater use of email and social media be used to promote repeated use of the digital service? Simply collecting information about how a service is running isn’t enough to make judgements about how to improve it. A process of continual iteration accompanying close measurement will help you to see what needs improvement and how to investigate ways of improving a service.  The core KPIs (cost per transaction, user satisfaction, completion rate and digital take-up) established in the service standard, and any other KPIs you choose to measure must accurately reflect the needs of your users and stakeholders.  This will allow you to measure a service’s ability to meet those needs. While building your service you should make sure that appropriate analytics tools are being used to monitor the service, collecting the data necessary to produce accurate and timely measurements. Guidance for choosing and installing these packages is available within the manual. Establish a ‘baseline’ based on current performance trends by channel, against which changes to the service will be judged. This will help you pinpoint the effectiveness of your initiatives, and identify what worked. It is good practice to look at performance trends over time, rather than take a snapshot at a particular point in time. Peaks and dips in performance are then measured relative to this base (or trend) line which helps to identify the effect of communications or design initiatives. It also reveals seasonal variations in performance. Collect and aggregate performance information from multiple sources and across multiple channels. Make sure you understand what this will mean in terms of system requirements. Combining data often reveals useful insights, for example into service efficiency (eg cost per transaction and total cost to serve) or proportional usage by channel (eg percentage digital uptake vs post, phone etc). Communicate performance information to your users through the appropriate dashboards, reports and alerts. Highlight specific segments that you know users are interested in, and make sure that your visualisations are simple, actionable and contain minimal amounts of chart junk. Typical segments include: By making your visualisations clearly visible you maximise the likelihood that the information will be acted upon - and services thereby improved. Best practices include: Test a range of performance improvement initiatives and monitor to see which work well. These can be piloted on a subset of your users to minimise risk. Implement the best performing solutions widely and then repeat this process relentlessly: what you measure will change over the course of a product or project’s lifetime. Any service that meets user needs will include an element of user feedback. This should be monitored and acted upon so as to continually improve the service for users. A range of options are available for improving the overall performance of a service. The following examples are based on the 4 Ps of marketing: Taking an iterative approach to service development increases the pace of improvement and minimises the risk of failure. Don’t wait until the end to do this, it should happen continuously throughout the process. This article in The Guardian shows online customer satisfaction scores for retailers. These scores are based on the Customer Satisfaction Index. Great article by Mike Loukides on the role of the data scientist. Total Cost to Serve is a method (PDF, 79k) for calculating the cost of a transaction for both the service provider and the user. HMRC have developed a method for calculating the cost of users time when interacting with government. This is important because some channels may be quicker to use than others.

This helps with the team owning the end-to-end quality of service. Widely shared metrics – knowing what good looks like across the service is important for everyone, and sharing high and low level metrics as widely as possible is a good way of building understanding. Automating repetitive tasks – using software development to automate tasks from across the service is a good way of fostering a better understanding of the whole service, as well as freeing up smart people from repetitive manual tasks. Post-mortems – issues will happen and making sure everyone from across different teams learns from them is critical. Running post-mortems with people from different groups is a great way of spreading knowledge. Regular releases – releasing software is often a bottleneck in siloed organisations, as the responsibilities of the different parts of the release are often spread out across teams. Getting to a point where you can release regularly (even many times a day) requires extreme collaboration and clever automation. devops tools (nearly always marketing) a devops team (in many cases this is just a new silo of skills and knowledge) devops as a job title (you wouldn’t call someone “an agile”) What devops means to me What is this devops thing anyway? What is devops (and the wall of confusion) There’s No Such Thing as a “Devops Team” Those interested in devops are often also interested in Configuration Management, Monitoring and Release Management Many large organisations have evolved to have very separate development, quality assurance and operations business units. In many cases the overhead of communications and the misaligned incentives of the different groups leads to slow delivery and a mountain of interconnected processes. In extreme cases these units may be geographically separated, work for different organisations or under completely different management structures. Devops is a cultural and professional movement which has grown out of these frustrations. It is not a methodology or framework, rather some high minded principles and a willingness to break down silos. Specifically devops is all about culture, automation, measurement and sharing. It is important to realise that devops requires a culture shift, towards shared ownership and collaboration across silos involved in building and managing a service. Especially for existing organisations this is by far the most important element. Many business processes are ripe for automation. Automation removes manual, error prone tasks allowing people to focus on the quality of the running service. Common areas that could benefit from automation are release management, provisioning, configuration management, systems integration, monitoring, orchestration and testing. Using data to drive change can be hugely powerful, in particular when it is done to involve people from different groups in the quality of the end-to-end service delivery. Collecting information from different teams and being able to compare it across former silos can be transformative on its own. People from different backgrounds (say development and operations) often have different, but intersecting skill sets. Encouraging sharing between groups helps to spread an understanding of the different areas of a successful service, making resolving issues about working together and not about contract negotiation. Without close collaboration between those building and testing software and those running it in production, the quality of the resulting service will be compromised. This happens in many ways, but the root cause is often functional silos; when one group owns a specific area (say quality) it’s easy for other areas to assume that area is no longer their concern. In areas like quality, release management or performance this is toxic. High quality digital services need to be able to adapt quickly to user needs, and this means close collaboration between different groups. A shared sense of ownership of the service and the problem is also important, as is a culture of making measurable improvements to how things work. Devops isn’t a project management methodology but you will hopefully adopt some of these good habits in your organisation. These aren’t unique to devops, but they do help with breaking down silos and with the above principles. Like agile, the term devops is often used for marketing or promotional purposes. This leads to a few common usages which are not necessarily in keeping with the above discussion.

Handling Time: How long does it take to deal with the contacts? Service Level: How quickly must we respond to user contacts? Staffing and Scheduling: How do we need to staff and schedule to achieve this? Data Collection and Reporting: How are things going now that we’re live? Going Further In order to provide high-quality service, you will very likely want a dedicated group of specialists – or current staff dedicating some of their time – to handle user enquiries and to help direct them to the information they want. We’ll use the term ‘Helpdesk’ to refer to them. Your planning will be greatly aided by drawing on the traditional contact centre management and planning skill sets; if you do not have access to staff with these skills, you may have to work closely with other groups who do in a consultancy capacity. This may include the team at GDS, or outside specialists. You’ll need to have some idea of the volume and type of contacts that you will receive for the service you’re supporting. In many cases, you can use historical data for similar services as a baseline.  This element of your planning will also need to take into account the contact channels you intend to support (eg email, phone, chat, Twitter, Facebook, surface mail, etc). Ideally, each of these channels will have a separate contact forecast to aid your planning.  This portion of your planning will also be informed by or will itself drive decisions about the technology you’ll use to route, handle, and store historical data from these contacts. You’ll also want to have at least some idea of the average handling time (AHT) and variance for each type of contact.  If you’re building with deep historical data, you may be able to model the AHT separately for each kind of contact. Minimally, you should use the best historical data available to calculate an average number of contacts per day that can be handled by a single agent doing a representative mix of contacts. You’ll also need to have an idea of the service level that should be maintained by your Helpdesk.   Generally, service level (SL or SLA) is expressed as x percent of contacts resolved in y time units. As an example, you might plan to answer 80% of your incoming email contacts in 24 hours.   You’ll need to know the desired service level to plan how many agents you’ll need for your Helpdesk.  Conversely, if your staffing is constrained by other factors, you may use this value as a constant and solve for the best service level that can be achieved at a certain volume level. Once you’ve planned for volume, handling time, and service level, you can finalise your demand forecast for contacts and plan to add staff as necessary to handle these contacts.  The same historical volume you used to create your contact forecast will likely give you an idea of how the contacts will be received throughout the planning period (likely a week). This, in turn, will give you good direction on how to schedule your Helpdesk staff to achieve the service level you’ve planned for. Once your Helpdesk is operational and actually supporting users, you can collect data on all the areas for which you planned. This data can then be used to improve and refine the forecasts you made previously and to create longer-term projections about the performance of your Helpdesk.   You will want to develop at least minimal reporting to allow you to evaluate how the group itself and the individuals in it are performing. Depending on the size of your Helpdesk and the details of your contact mix, this might be very detailed and sophisticated or very simple, but you’ll want to plan for how to measure these elements from the very beginning.  The points above are good starting points to consider as you plan to support new digital products and initiatives. There is a quite extensive body of online information that expands on the points made here, including some free planning tools. However, as with all areas of specialised knowledge, you should ideally access the services of an experienced analyst rather than depending entirely on online sources for guidance.","description":"In order to provide high-quality service, you will very likely want a dedicated group of specialists – or current staff dedicating some of their time – to handle user enquiries and to help direct them to the information they want.

This guide will help you decide how you host your applications and the things to think about if selecting a vendor. The recommended approach is to involve a small cross-functional group of people. They will quickly assess different options, shortlist suppliers, interview  and finally make a decision. This group should include people with a knowledge of the available procurement options and acceptable costs but must include people with a hands-on technical understanding of the service and underlying software. It is important to keep good notes from any interviews or deliberation sessions and to assess different suppliers equally. A scoring matrix can help here. It is worth stating that it’s very common to use multiple suppliers. This may be due to them offering different but compatible services or potentially for additional redundancy. This can be technically challenging but for larger projects can provide extra resilience. There are a number of different approaches taken by suppliers of hosting services, which can make comparing offerings difficult. The following is intended only as a brief introduction. This advice is complicated because many service providers redefine the meanings of hosting terms for marketing reasons. In particular Infrastructure as a service and Platform as a service are marketable at the moment and often used incorrectly. Always look into the details of the services being offered. For particularly large projects with very specific requirements you may decide that purchasing hardware and even running a dedicated data centre is suitable. The costs and timescales involved here are very high and this is unlikely to be the best option in most cases. Many providers offer co-location services which is where you purchase your own hardware to put into a managed data centre. This provides a great deal of flexibility but can introduce lead times and other physical constraints. It also requires a wide range of technical specialist skills.  Lots of service providers have a shared or managed hosting option. This tends to mean renting specific virtual or physical machines for fixed periods of time. Different suppliers offer different management services; some just manage the underlying machine while others will support the operating system and even specific applications running on the machines. In the last several years Infrastructure as a service has become a common approach to managing hosting and infrastructure requirements. This tends to involve a capability to rapidly add or remove capacity, often in minutes, and to be billed only for what is used. This provides a great deal of flexibility and the ability to hold costs down but also requires a degree of technical skill to manage well.  Similar to Infrastructure as a service above, Platform as a service offerings tend to allow for quickly adding or removing capacity and fine-grained pay on demand pricing. The difference is is that you are abstracted away from the underlying infrastructure completely. The unit here is the running application, not a virtual or physical machine. Using a Platform as a service places a number of constraints on the software architecture but can move the support burden for parts of the stack onto the supplier. Making a decision about your hosting supplier involves weighing up a wide range of different components, including: This is, unfortunately, a technical field with many options. Seemingly similar services can have wildly different architectures or different cost models can result in large differences in total cost of ownership. It is recommended to involve technical colleagues or trusted third parties in any discussions and decision.","description":"The software running your service will need servers to run on.

As a government service it is important that your systems and applications are performant and can deal with expected (and unexpected) levels of traffic.  This means doing some capacity planning work up front but it also means doing specific load and performance testing.  Capacity planning is the process of determining what amount of infrastructure and software is required to run a live system. Importantly you should also look at how this changes over time. Will traffic or database load increase every month as the site grows, or are some days or months (self assessment deadline or bank holidays) particularly spikey.  The output should help with both estimating ongoing costs as well as setting up realistic load and performance tests. There are several companies that offer products and services around load testing. In many cases working with these can be useful, especially for final testing or testing of mature components.  However it’s important to also have some capability within your development team to do more ad-hoc load and performance testing. This is important to allow for a rapid iterative development style, otherwise scalability or performance issues may be introduced but caught late, when they are much harder to fix. Although related, and tested in similar ways, load testing and performance testing are done for different reasons. It’s worth understanding the subtle difference and making sure you consider both when testing and analysing results. We test sites and applications under realistic load to ensure that, when launched, they work for the people using them. This should involve testing in load in excess of expected traffic in order to simulate certain types of Denial of Service (DoS) attack, including a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. Even if a site or application is able to scale out successfully it doesn’t mean it is fast. Site performance is a factor of many things, from the software running the site to the networks, proxies and caches involved in serving traffic over the internet.  Fast sites are generally much more effective to the extent that Google now includes performance in its algorithms for determining which sites to feature in search results.","description":"History is littered with countless government projects which collapsed under load or which worked slowly enough to frustrate users.

Your ability to act quickly and constructively on user feedback will ultimately depend on the degree to which you can stratify contacts for analysis. Depending on the complexity of your contact types and the sophistication of the systems you use to handle them, this might be almost completely manual (with metadata created for the contact by the staff handling it) or largely automated (with the software you use to aid contact handling adding most of the metadata automatically). Minimally, you’ll want to stratify contacts by channel (phone, email, chat, social media, surface mail, etc) and by the target group that can act on the feedback. For example, some feedback may be directly dealt with by your organisation, while other types may need to be sent to other departments or groups for their use. In addition to the very basic channel and target stratifications mentioned above, you will likely want to consider the following categories as potentially applicable to your contacts/feedback: Enquiry type Is the contact a:  Requester details You will want to be very thoughtful about data collection of user details, given privacy concerns, but you will almost certainly want to gather minimal detail on the requesters of your contacts. Reply type Is a reply necessary/expected or not? Enquiry status Whether a contact is open, pending some other action, solved, etc Enquiry category or categories Some internal sectional or functional categories along which you’ll want to be able to stratify–think of separate URLs or sections on a large website as a concrete example. Service category or categories Aspects of the handling processes you use that you should capture for further analysis–support level, priority, internal resolving group, resolving agent(s), day/date/time received, and day/date/time resolved are all examples you’ll likely want to have available for analysis. Root cause category or categories The ultimate reason for the contact; for example, page failing to load, database down, forgotten password, user error, software bug, etc. As with most of these categories, you will tailor these categories based on the specifics of your product and support model. Once you have gathered data for contact stratification, you’ll need to decide how to share it. If all the data can be handled and used directly within your organisation then this step may be easier, however there will likely be different teams that will act on different types of problems, some of them outside of your department. Depending on the nature of your contact handling systems, you may be able to use automation to do most of this routing, and you should plan for that if possible. One very ambitious improvement model that you can use treats each contact from a user as ultimately due to a defect in the service itself, either in your support model for it or in the communications processes you use to handle contacts.  While this perhaps overstates the reality for some kinds of contacts–is a user’s email of thanks and appreciation genuinely a defect?–it is an excellent way to focus critical thinking on how you provide service.  Once the contact-level improvement data has been sent to the right group, you can begin doing analysis for process improvement. You may want to marry your contact level data with cost data to help prioritise which areas to target first, but you may also simply use the number (or percentage) of affected users as a prioritisation mechanism.  In any case, you will want to have access to staff with experience in process analysis and improvement, ideally with relevant contact centre or technology experience. Directly involving the individuals who handle contacts and those who built the service into improvement projects will yield better and faster results.","description":"Once you have created a helpdesk, you will want to figure out how to make the best use of user feedback to improve your service and the user experience.","link":"/service-manual/operations/managing-user-support.html"},{"title":"Monitoring","indexable_content":"Setup monitoring early Include high level checks Errors are interesting Widely available Further reading to be alerted to problems affecting the availability of the service so they can be resolved to aid with capacity planning activities by providing metrics over time to identify potential future problems to find areas of improvement, for instance badly performing systems or inefficient services to be able to identify the root cause of an outage after the fact, based on data collected during the problematic event Radiating Information gives examples of some of the monitoring dashboards used while building GOV.UK Open Source Monitoring explains some of the terminology and available open-source tools Any online application should have some tools dedicated to alerting the people running the service to problems. This might involve low level issues involving the infrastructure underpinning the service to a sudden high rate of user errors. Knowing the current state of your service and infrastructure can help identify problems before they happen, as well as alert you to issues that need immediate attention. The main goals are: Monitoring is not something that should be left to the end, to be tacked on as part of running the final production service. By talking about monitoring, and agreeing an approach, you are more likely to build useful checks as you go along. Writing tests at the same time as writing code is common, monitoring checks can be viewed as tests for the running system. Often monitoring is seen through a very technical lens, so teams may only look at web application performance, available disk space or memory usage. Although these are important it’s also essential to track these alongside more business related metrics.  For example being able to compare page loading tests with failed transactions and application errors can alert you to problems and help identify the cause at the same time. It also grounds conversations about low level problems (disk space, slow performance) in terms of the service performance.  When errors occur they should be recorded and tracked over time. Errors always contain interesting information, potentially about a user problem, attacks in progress, failing systems or just a capacity problem.  It’s important to be able to see errors both at the level of the entire system and related to a particular application or machine. The monitoring system, or rather any dashboards, interactive tools or reports, should be as widely available as possible. They should ideally be useful outside just the group responsible for the day to day operations and systems administration.","description":"Any online application should have some tools dedicated to alerting the people running the service to problems.

Government offers a number of different digital services to citizens. While the start and end of a user’s journey will be on GOV.UK, the service itself will typically be hosted elsewhere, and will need a different domain name as a result. This page describes the use of service.gov.uk subdomains for hosting digital services. Note: This document is written as a ‘standard’, and as such uses the words MUST, SHOULD, MAY and MUST NOT as defined in RFC 2119. Every digital service offered by the UK government MUST have a single, well-known place on the Internet where users can go to when they want to use the service. That well-known place will be the relevant start page on GOV.UK – for instance, the DVLA’s tax disc service is at https://www.gov.uk/tax-disc. Service managers MUST NOT advertise any URL other than that of the GOV.UK start page as the starting point for the relevant service. This is what gets printed on literature and used in email signatures, TV adverts, etc. The start page URL for a given service will be allocated by GDS based on discussions with the service manager and analysis of user behaviour, search referrals and other relevant data. The transactional part of a service – the dynamically generated pages where users interact with the service – will typically not be hosted on the www.gov.uk domain. That means that each service needs its own domain name for the transactional part of the service. Note: This does not apply to the set of interactive tools on GOV.UK known as ‘smart answers’ which are developed and maintained by GDS in partnership with other government departments. For all new digital government services going live from 1 April 2013 GDS will create a domain name of the form servicename.service.gov.uk (where “servicename” is a plain English description of the service agreed between the relevant dept/agency and the Government Digital Service). This will introduce consistency across central government domains for digital services and remove the dependency on departmental subdomains (which are of course vulnerable to machinery of government changes) and the now-retired DirectGov and BusinessLink online brands. The process of obtaining a service.gov.uk subdomain begins either when the service manager asks a Government Digital Service product manager for a start page on GOV.UK (for services already under development at 13 March 2013) or when the service manager asks for a subdomain to be created via the GOV.UK service desks’s government contact form (for services where development starts after 13 March 2013).  Subdomains of service.gov.uk SHOULD describe the service (eg lastingpowerofattorney.service.gov.uk) and SHOULD NOT contain the name of the service owning department or agency (eg ministryofmagicwandregistration.service.gov.uk) The service-owning dept/agency will be given delegated authority to manage the domain and its subdomains, although in some cases this work will be carried out by third party suppliers. This section gives some guidance about which subdomains a service manager should create once they have been given control of servicename.service.gov.uk. Maximum number of visible subdomains The user-facing live service SHOULD be operated using at most three user-visible subdomains of servicename.service.gov.uk: You SHOULD NOT create separate domains for APIs unless there’s a really good reason to have a completely separate domain. (Really good reasons are few and far between.) Service managers should notify the Government Digital Service technical architects (via your Transformation team contact) if you intend to create user-visible subdomains other than the three listed above. We’re developing some patterns for more unusual system designs as well as for mainstream transactional services, and we’re always up for a discussion about exceptions and edge cases. Usernames and passwords If the service is a private alpha or private beta release then it should be protected by a username and password known only to the development team and the users who are testing the service. If a service, or part of a service, is a public alpha or beta releases then it should be clearly marked as such with a text label on every page (ie don’t use an image containing the word alpha or beta) and in every API response. Multiple environments It is good practice to have multiple ‘environments’ for the development, testing and live (aka production) versions of any service. The development and testing environments allow the team to assess the correctness and quality of the service before it goes live. Typically, the subdomains used to access a development or testing instance of the service are structured in the same way as the subdomains used in the live version of the service. Therefore, you MAY create other subdomains of servicename.service.gov.uk for use in testing and development, such as www-preview. and www-dev.. If there is a compelling reason to use a non .gov.uk domain for testing and/or development subdomains, that’s also acceptable. Regardless of the domain name used, web-based services on testing and development domains (including APIs) should be protected by a username and password along the same lines as private alpha and beta releases. Many services will collect personal information from users. It’s very important that this information can’t be intercepted by malicious third parties as it travels over the Internet. Therefore, all services accessed through service.gov.uk domains (including APIs) MUST only be accessible through secure connections. For web-based services this means HTTPS only (often referred to by the acronyms TLS or SSL, which both refer to the protocol underpinning these secure connections). Services MUST NOT accept HTTP connections under any circumstances. Once a service manager has verified that their HTTPS setup is working fine they SHOULD enable HSTS on the production domains (www., admin. and assets.), by setting HTTP an HTTP response header such as representing a commitment to HTTPS-only traffic for 14 days. Once the service manager is confident that HSTS is configured correctly, you SHOULD increase the commitment to months or years: Cookies used on www.servicename.service.gov.uk and admin.servicename.service.gov.uk MUST be scoped to the originating domain only. Cookies MUST NOT be scoped to the domain servicename.service.gov.uk. Cookies SHOULD NOT be used on assets.servicename.service.gov.uk (they introduce a browser overhead that slows down the response time for users without providing any benefit for the service manager). Cookies MUST be sent with the Secure attribute and SHOULD, where appropriate, be sent with the HttpOnly attribute. These flags provide additional assurances about how cookies will be handled by browsers. GOV.UK is the place for users to find all government services, so it’s important to ensure that users always start on the relevant GOV.UK page, rather than a different or duplicate start page on www.servicename.service.gov.uk. As a result, services need to ask search engines not to index pages on their domains, so that the relevant GOV.UK page and the service domain don’t compete with each other in search engine results. This can be achieved by redirecting users to the relevant GOV.UK start page if they go directly to the service’s domain name, and by asking search engines not to index pages on the service’s domain name. Therefore, every service hosted on a service.gov.uk domain MUST: Have a robots.txt file on the www, admin and assets subdomains asking search engines not to index any part of the site. Example content for robots.txt is given below, and more details can be found on The Web Robots Pages: Have an HTTP 301 redirection from the top-level index page of the www and assets subdomains to the relevant start page on GOV.UK. (Note: this means that the service start page on GOV.UK SHOULD NOT link to the root of the www domain.) If you have contracted with CDN-based DDOS-protection suppliers then you SHOULD register the following additional subdomains for use by your suppliers: Your suppliers will use these subdomains to address your www, admin and assets services. Detailed configuration advice for origin servers is outside of the scope of this document, but it is important to ensure that these ‘origin domains’ only listen for traffic from trusted source such as At present we advise against allowing DDOS protection suppliers to terminate SSL connections for transactional services carrying personal information, but this behaviour is not prohibited at present. Although SSL termination on the third party network would allow the supplier(s) to carry out additional analysis and potentially extra mitigations against certain types of attack, it would also give the supplier access to all the personal information being submitted to your service. There are obvious downsides to allowing this level of access, especially if the supplier’s network and processes have not been accredited to the same level as the rest of the service. It’s a risk based decision, but if in doubt we suggest a presumption against SSL termination on third party networks. Many suppliers offer IP forwarding DDOS protection, which does not have the same security issues as SSL termination, and is recommended in preference to SSL termination.  If your service requires transaction monitoring (which is not at all the same thing as DDOS protection) you should contact your CESG account manager for advice.  This is interim guidance and will be updated - check back in early May 2013 for an update. Emails to users of your service SHOULD be sent from a human-monitored email address that originates from the domain servicename.service.gov.uk (and not the dept/agency or any other domain name). You SHOULD enable SPF on the sending domain. You MAY also want to use DKIM on the sending domain; it can provide additional guarantees about message delivery and help recipients to more easily distinguish genuine mail from forgery.","description":"Government offers a number of different digital services to citizens.

In order to identify vulnerabilities it is often a good idea to involve an independent body to help find potential security problems before releasing to the public. Sometimes referred to as pen testing, vulnerability and penetration testing is the act of analysing and testing a service for security problems. This is often a specialist activity done via a third party. It’s often a good idea to view security testing as an ongoing activity for any project, not as a final check. Security is important to both a product and technical audience. It’s essential that vulnerability testing reports and the risks they identify are understood by non-technical audiences as well a developer audience.  Security is rarely binary, in that it’s not generally a matter of being secure or not, rather reducing the risks of a wide range of potential issues. CESG are the National Technical Authority for Information Assurance. Based at Cheltenham they provide both standards and advice for information security.  For any sizable project it is wise to engage with them as early as possible. They can provide guidance and expertise on potential problems and help you make sure the right things are tested. Testing for security issues should be done throughout the development of a service, as well as regularly when it’s up and running. Having third parties do this testing is a good way of introducing genuine experts and getting a different view on something. However it’s also important to make sure the team building the software know that security is the responsibility of the team, and not something that is outsourced. Remember that when testing for vulnerability to look at the whole system, not just the software involved.  An obvious example would be physical security (where is the equipment housed and how secure is it?) but a more interesting example is often the interplay between an online system and a call centre.  It may be that by using information available from a call centre you can exploit the software system in some way. For instance, getting a call-centre team to change an email address on record for someone else, and then using a forgotten password facility which relies on the email address being trusted. Although some level of exploratory manual testing is always a good idea when looking for vulnerabilities this is time-consuming and expensive. Having some level of automation can often be a good idea. This may take the form of tests written or tools used specifically to test the security of a feature. For instance static analysis or input fuzz testing. The web is a hostile environment, and the nature of Government services means they can be targets for a wide range of different threats; from financially motivated criminals and online activists up to nation states. Even where personal or sensitive information is not at risk the reputation of government can be damaged by even the smallest issues. Web application exploits tend to follow a relatively small number of common patterns, which means automated and manual testing, as well as awareness of these common problems can have a drastic effect on the security of the system. The Government Accreditation processes mandate some form of vulnerability testing, often working with CHECK approved suppliers. This should be viewed as the minimum effort required. ","description":"Ensuring web based systems and applications are secure requires more than just good design and development. In order to identify vulnerabilities it is often a good idea to involve an independent body to help find potential security problems before releasing to the public.","link":"/service-manual/operations/penetration-testing.html"},{"title":"Alpha phase","indexable_content":"What is the objective of an alpha?

Each project features many challenges, and in your alpha you will start exploring solutions for these. You may need to bring more developers and designers into the team, who will help you to build and test prototypes and possible solutions for your users needs. By the end of the alpha you should have a clear idea of what’s required to build a beta. The whole phase should not last longer than about six to eight weeks.  The objective is to build a working prototype. This will be used by stakeholders or a closed group of end users to: Continue to build upon and analyse the research you have commissioned on user needs and use this to set up an open, engagement process with your stakeholders. Involve a wide range of stakeholders from the private, voluntary and other parts of the public sector. Run a series of workshops with these stakeholders to develop your options. Following demonstration of your alpha, you may choose to discard the code and start fresh in the beta. If, however, your code is robust enough you may continue to iterate against your prototype. Develop options for the assisted digital support for your service. To help develop the options, continue to build upon and analyse the research you have commissioned on user needs. Bring in the expertise of organisations working with people who are offline and users themselves. Run workshops to develop your options. The alpha doesn’t need to be a complete, end-to-end transaction. You’re looking to demonstrate just enough so users gain some understanding of the service. Think of it as a proof-of-concept. Is the solution appropriate? Is your approach viable? Do you have enough understanding of your users’ needs to meet them? If not, find out more and make a new prototype. The alpha phase is another relatively short phase. At GDS, we try to limit these to about two months, running in week long sprints over a 6-8 week period. This phase involves a relatively small core team, who will be capable of rapidly iterating solutions. It will probably expand and contract in size as different specialisms are required. This core team will be a mix of stakeholders, and makers (designers and developers) particularly those familiar with user research. It will be led by the service manager.","description":"When designing a service it is impossible to predict everything up-front.

What next? Data Let your users know Plan to redirect traffic Previous phase: live    When we retired the DirectGov, BusinessLink and departmental websites, we invested a lot of effort in mapping content on those sites to GOV.UK content. We redirected as many of the old sites’ URLs as we could to corresponding GOV.UK URLs, and provided ‘Gone’ pages with links to the National Archive where the content was not being transferred. We wrote about that in “No Link Left Behind”  Even the best services may eventually reach retirement. Changes in policy may mean that the service is no longer offered or new understanding may mean that those user needs are better provided through a different service. Whatever the reason, the retirement of digital services should be handled with the same degree of care as their creation, with a constant focus on user needs. Your service will have been built to serve user needs. It’s vital to understand how those needs are to be addressed once your service has been retired, whether they are deemed to no longer exist, are no longer served by government, or will in future be served as part of another service. If the needs will no longer be met by government but will now be met by the private or voluntary sectors then it is important to understand what organisations will be expected to fill that function so that they can be adequately prepared and so that the appropriate online user journey can be developed. Similarly, if the needs are to be served as part of another government service or services then you should identify which services they are and begin a dialogue with those services’ teams so they can learn from your experience and so that you can understand how you will support your users to make the transition. The vast majority of users of your service will begin and end their journeys via GOV.UK. As soon as you know that your service is likely to be retired you should contact the GOV.UK team to ensure that those journeys are amended and appropriate information is supplied. The GOV.UK team will need to know why the service is being retired, and how those user needs are to be served in future so that they can provide the appropriate information, advice and links to users. For that majority of users who begin and end their journeys on GOV.UK the most important thing is to ensure that GOV.UK is updated. There will be some users, however, who access your service directly whether via links in emails, bookmarks on their computer or remembering your URLs. It’s important to prepare them for the change and lay out clearly what it will mean to them. Your planning should aim to produce the minimum possible disruption for users, but it will still be a significant change for them so details of what the change is, why it’s being made, what they will need to do, and what will happen to their data should be made easily available. Users who access your service via an API will need time to update their software to use the replacement service’s APIs or to make other relevant adjustments. You should reach out to your API users as early as possible and remember that they may have significant lead times for making and distributing changes. Changes to the service online will also need to be seamlessly tied in with messaging to offline users who are receiving the service through assisted digital channels. Once GOV.UK is updated the majority the vast majority of users will begin to be directed to the new service. Some users will still try and access the service at its current (now retired) home. You should have a plan for redirecting those requests to the appropriate new service, or to provide clear information about the service that has been retired in perpetuity. When we retired the DirectGov, BusinessLink and departmental websites, we invested a lot of effort in mapping content on those sites to GOV.UK content. We redirected as many of the old sites’ URLs as we could to corresponding GOV.UK URLs, and provided ‘Gone’ pages with links to the National Archive where the content was not being transferred. We wrote about that in “No Link Left Behind” In running your service you will have accrued a large amount of data about the service and its users. You should already have policies in place to manage that data responsibly, including details of how long it will be retained. Those policies will continue to apply, and you will need to ensure that there is support in place to maintain them. Where data is being transferred to a new service owner, that should be done in accordance with your existing data protection policies, and communicated clearly to your users.","description":"Even the best services may eventually reach retirement.

You should avoid point-to-point bespoke integration between systems to reduce costs and inter-dependencies Architecture is not just about the design and deployment of technology - to be successful you will need to understand how several elements work together. These include: The term “architecture” includes both the logical design as well as its physical implementation. Logical architecture based on user-centric service design and clear user needs should always precede physical architecture - at a minimum you need to understand what capabilities are required before starting to narrow down on product choices. The technology code of practice provides guidance on the consistent use of technology across government. Our reference model draws upon modern platform-based architectures. We should use the highly scalable open platform model of internet-scale organisations and draw upon the practical experience of other governments like Estonia.  Note: examples are for illustration purposes only. To support this our architecture will need to move away from tightly-coupled and proprietary models towards an open, interoperable architecture using open standards and open interfaces, eg XML- and JSON-based data services, to maximise government’s flexibility and improve the speed of delivery of services. We should strive to: Duplication is OK when used to optimise the user experience (but there should be clear master-slave data relationships should information itself be replicated, eg for reasons of performance). Products and Services are the things that users engage with to find information or complete transactions. As such, they should be designed around the needs of the end user rather than the service provider. They can be either Mission IT (internal facing) or Digital Public Services (external facing). Platforms provide a set of open interfaces, protocols, data formats and tools that enable software developers to rapidly deliver products and services. Examples of platforms are the GOV.UK publishing platform, the performance platform, and the identity assurance platform - they are not things like ‘Windows Server’ or ‘Linux Server’. Platform should be kept as simple as possible, but designed to have no barriers to scaling up and scaling out. New features should be added only when required by new product needs - platforms emerge from the demands of products rather than being driven by top-down architectural process. More on government platforms can be found here. “Legacy” is used as shorthand to reference existing mission IT systems and components that have been designed to meet historic requirements. Often they are built using technologies that have become difficult and expensive to maintain or change. Examples of legacy applications are likely to span benefits systems, case management systems, and customer relationship management systems. Over time the dependence on legacy platforms should be reduced as successful new platforms are developed.

Separate commodity from niche needs. Use cost-effective commodity services for infrastructure and utility business activities like office productivity (word processing, spreadsheets and presentation software, email, scheduling and collaboration). Identify and acquire capabilities rather than infrastructure where services required are bespoke/innovative. Ensure that any procurement is designed to encourage competition and follows published Government Procurement Policy. [Competition will be encouraged with no like-for-like extensions to existing contracts. The renewal of incumbent products, services and suppliers, or the stipulation of their brands, is not permitted: there must always be an open and competitive specification and reprocurement process. All requirements must be expressed in terms of business outcomes and user needs – not solutions or product feature sets. Programmes will be ‘disaggregated’ for commercial purposes - broken down into components supported by the market to enable many suppliers to bid. There is a presumption that no procurement will have a lifetime cost over £100m. Contract lengths for services should be kept to the minimum level necessary to ensure commercial flexibility.] Purchase networking and telephony services through the Public Services Network frameworks. Objectively evaluate potential public cloud solutions first – before you consider any other option. In order to do this you will need to identify the capabilities and services that make up your technology design, and demonstrate that the solution chosen represents best value for money. Follow the guidelines laid out in the EUD strategy, design and implementation guidance to ensure your solution will work for any end user device. Ensure best environmental practices, whether in-house or via external suppliers, including compliance with Greening Government ICT. Any software licence agreements must evidence actual user needs – there should be no default continuation of enterprise licence deals or specification of products or brands. Share resources: services, information, data and software components must be shared in order to encourage reuse, avoid duplication and prevent redundant investments. Re-use includes the use of existing services and capabilities that already exist outside of government where they provide best value for money, eg identity verification, fraud and debt management, cloud-based commodity services. Align to the shared services strategy for HR, procurement, finance and payroll. Plan on using an agile process, starting with the user need. Waterfall should only be used by exception and where it can be shown to better meet user need. Projects may need the best of both formal and agile methods, playing to their respective strengths: delivering successful IT services is about knowing when to use the right tool at the right time. Demonstrate that adequate capability is available within your organisation – you should not outsource strategic decision-making or service accountability. If the necessary capability does not exist in-house, then you need to evidence a plan for developing or recruiting people with the right skills and experience.

Your digital services are based on user needs, not on organisation structures and processes. You have: To deliver better public services you’ll need to change existing behaviours and cultures and successfully transition to new ways of working. You may need to develop the skills within your team and keep up to date on new methods and technologies. It may also be necessary to change your physical working environment to get the best out of your team. You may need to radically change governance and management structures and will need to run projects in a more agile way. You will need to build relationships with new suppliers that you may have found through new procurement routes, such as the G-Cloud. It may be necessary and more cost-effective to write-off previous financial investments, so you will need courage and conviction to stop spending on old, legacy systems. The Cabinet Office, through the IT spend controls, has a strong preference against extending contracts to support legacy systems. At the very least you will need an exit management strategy that sets out a plan for how you will significantly reduce any dependence on outdated technology. The cost of maintaining out of date technology that isn’t fit for purpose could far outweigh the cost of changing to a more suitable technology that better meets user needs. If you’re in this position, it’s also likely that the architecture and hosting of your existing estate may need to be rethought. You may come across inertia or resistance when you try to make necessary changes to your technology or how your service is provided. Your existing supplier base will tend to resist change – and the more successful a supplier has been working under the old model, and the more entrenched it is, the greater this resistance is likely to be. The changes needed will often be more successfully initiated and delivered by those not encumbered by past success – new market entrants and those traditionally closed-out from government business, such as small- or medium-sized businesses. You may find that you have become locked-in to a particular contract or technology. As part of your consideration of the total cost of ownership of a particular solution, you should have estimated the cost of exit at the start of implementation. If you try to move and find that cost is a barrier, any unlocking costs that you have identified must be associated with the incumbent supplier/system and not be considered as part of the cost of a new solution. Building on open standards or selecting products which use them will help you to avoid this problem in the future. If you have incumbent suppliers, it is important that you understand and anticipate their likely reaction as they struggle to maintain the status quo and resist change. Incumbent suppliers will have data that reflects the past success of their business models and the way their business worked. They will be less certain about the future and may be concerned about the weakening of their market share and their exposure to genuine, open competition. The rewards and culture of these companies are likely to be built on their current business model. That will reinforce their internal resistance to change. It is difficult for them to persuade shareholders and financial investors to replace a well-understood, if obsolete, business model with an approach that favours the treatment of some IT products as commodities. The IT as utility market is not yet fully established, so they will be uncertain about it even though this model might bring them higher profits on lower revenues. You will also see similar resistance in-house, where many staff may have long grown accustomed to old ways of working. It is important that as a leader you provide the assistance and mentoring they need to help update their skills and experience. Some may have become dependent on external suppliers’ advice. Some may even have built their career on accreditation in a single supplier’s technologies. Flexible technology and services give service managers the ability evolve services and make them responsive to users needs. It also avoids costly and more risky big bang changes. Reducing the risk of lock-in to suppliers, software, service and support, or to old and inefficient IT, means that you have the ability to choose what best meets the outcomes you are looking for at a sustainable and competitive cost and at a timescale that suits you. GOV.UK is an example of how this works in practice. On the technology side, we set up hosting to build the beta of GOV.UK and then transferred it to a new supplier on the G-Cloud framework.

The ICT Strategy committed the government to developing and implementing an end user device strategy. This strategy has aimed to address historic issues, including user tools that do not meet user needs, degrade civil service productivity, and provide poor user experiences. These issues have been compounded by: The Civil Service Reform Plan requires departments to address “frustrating” IT tools for civil servants. A Workplace Transformation programme will streamline working practises, supported by effective IT. The Government Protective Marking Scheme Review and resultant Security Classification Policy, together with the Open Standards policy, require a reform of the principles by which IT tools for civil servants are designed, procured and managed. Civil servants are expected to take responsibility and apply reasonable judgement when dealing with information, removing the need for overbearing technical controls. The Government and Departmental Digital Strategies establish user needs as the central focus of digital services and tools. This requires a step change in agility to meet changing user needs, together with an excellent user experience. We need to get 4 basic things right: The end user device strategy will help departments and suppliers understand what kinds of design decisions they should now be making. There’s specific guidance on the standards that need to be met to ensure that digital services don’t become heavily dependent on particular products or suppliers, and a new security framework has been developed with CESG (the government’s specialist technology security advisors) for those working with government information across all types of mobile devices.","description":"The ICT Strategy committed the government to developing and implementing an end user device strategy.

Moving to the platform model Working with organisations outside of government Tim O’Reilly’s “Government as a Platform” Agile Architecture The government is implementing a platform-based operating model. Google, Amazon, Twitter and Facebook, amongst many others, have all built their success on the back of platforms. They have developed a core technology infrastructure that others have then built upon, driving the success of the platform and meeting far more users’ needs than the original provider could have done on their own. One simple analogy for a platform is the Lego brick, which provides the basis for constructing many different products from the same components. The GOV.UK publishing platform provides the basis for many different products and services to be provided to citizens and businesses. Businesses like Amazon iterate and improve their services based on data, not intuition or guesswork. Their services are built on common technology platforms (search, recommendations, purchase, etc). They deliver a scalable, consistent high quality user experience using open source and open standards. Their world looks something like this:  Whilst government can learn from this model, it cannot simplistically copy it. Government has many diverse and complex legacy systems and processes, almost all of them operating in silos. As a consequence, government currently looks something like this:  This move to a platform-based model is a significant transition. A platform provides essential technology infrastructure, including core applications that demonstrate the potential of the platform. Other organisations and developers can use the platform to innovate and build upon. The core platform provider enforces “rules of the road” (such as the open technical standards and processes to be used) to ensure consistency, and that applications based on the platform will work well together. Moving to a platform model does not imply a “top-down” conceptual identification of a list of platforms that government will buy or build. Platforms will emerge out of user needs and good architectural practices, but only as a consequence of the practical experience of building the features required. Platforms are defined by connectors and functionality – characterised by open interfaces, open data standards, and commonality. The figures below illustrate the journey required.   A move to platforms does not mean that government has to develop everything in-house: many of government’s needs can be met by existing cost-efficient utility services. However, government can help to establish best practice in areas such as personal data privacy. Wherever appropriate, the government should use existing external platforms, such as payments services (ranging from third party merchant acquirer services to the UK’s national payments infrastructure). Deciding to develop platforms in-house will happen only where that is the best way to meet users’ needs in the most flexible and cost-effective way. Government will draw upon the experience of other organisations that have already made this journey. Many have created platforms that initially sit across the top of existing silos to expedite agile and effective digital service delivery. This co-existence enables the benefits of the platform model to be realised quickly, even in a brownfield environment such as government, whilst the silos below the waterline are gradually reduced in importance and eventually made obsolete. This is the approach that government will follow, ensuring that it develops a well-defined schedule for switching off legacy environments as the platform model is progressively implemented.

There is also data on how people use these services and who those people are. Data about service performance allows service managers to see how well a service is running. It also means that users can hold us to account. Data about service performance should therefore be public data. You should publish all public data, unless it is private data collected from people or restricted for national security reasons. Public data is anonymised data: If for some reason you have made a procurement choice that means your performance data is monitored or stored by a third party, you should make sure that you have the right to access, export, share and reuse that data openly and in an open format. Your department has its own Open Data Strategy (for 2012-2014) and will already be publishing data sets on data.gov.uk. Your commitment to open, public data doesn’t stop there. Your open data should be user-friendly and searchable. For instance, all data published on data.gov.uk is searchable and placed on a 5-star rating scheme to indicate how useable and easy to interpret the data is. You should aim to reach at least the Three Star standard. The Open Data Principles that you must follow are: Users are already using your services, giving you lots of data about their behaviour. This means you can learn from real world behaviour when you’re designing a new digital service. You can watch and learn from your users, shaping the system to fit what people naturally choose to do. Recognise that you can’t do it all. In making your data open, you are encouraging greater use of the data and helping users to innovate. Developers need to be able to use the data, to share it, and combine it with other data to use in their own applications, for example through APIs. As with all government digital services you’ll need to understand the user need for the data you publish. You’ll need to keep developers aware of what datasets you are releasing and to maintain relationships with those primary data users at the cutting edge of technology who can help you to do things differently and in more agile ways. You can use the engagement areas of data.gov.uk to reach out and keep in touch with data users. You need to be scrupulous in protecting individual privacy by taking appropriate steps to ensure personal data is secure. You should consider privacy issues at the beginning of all discussions concerning the release of a new dataset or the building of or change to a digital service dealing with personal data. If you are using new technology to handle personal data or reusing the data in a different way, you may need to carry out a Privacy Impact Assessment. This is a key part of the process for identifying and managing risk. The Cabinet Office is preparing a new Code of Practice (Datasets) (the consultation on this draft version is now closed). This Code includes the licensing framework you must use when making your datasets available for reuse. There are a number of licenses in the framework. You can choose one to suit your particular needs. For free UK Government data, this will be the Open Government Licence. Your open data can give: Building your services on open formats and open standards means that you can more easily share, reuse or exchange data. It will also mean that you will have a choice in which technology to implement, rather than being limited to a particular product or supplier.

You can also find case studies of how people are sharing, using and building open data on the data.gov.uk site.

Accreditation of Government Systems is costly, time consuming, and doesn’t help secure them. 3. Open source software is more / less secure than proprietary code. 4. “Product X can’t be used because it isn’t accredited by CESG” 5. RESTRICTED systems need to have bespoke security controls. 6. “I’m not a target for cyber attack!” 7. Impact Levels define security requirements. 8. “I’ve got lots of IL3 records, which aggregate to IL4, so I need to build a CONFIDENTIAL back end system” Protecting information from valid threats to its confidentiality, integrity and availability is an enabler of digital services. Without such protection, digital services would be impossible or unsafe. Please note: This guide sets out the governing principles for developing efficiently secured digital services. It also busts some common myths around security. There is another guide about the practical process of security accreditation. Security must be applied intelligently. This means analysing the probable interest in official information from threat sources, establishing their capabilities and methods, and matching proportionate mitigations against these in a traceable manner. Other attempts at security run the risk of over-engineering security controls, or providing an illusion of security by not mitigating the actual risks. Technology alone is never capable of addressing security and privacy risks: there needs to be a risk model that spans technology, people (their behaviours and culture), and processes. Bad user experience arising from over-prescriptive use of technology can lead users to circumvent security controls by employing less secure unofficial IT solutions. Users who then retain the official IT systems suffer degraded productivity. The outcome is that security is not maintained and user experience is unpleasant. However, security and a good user experience do not need to be mutually exclusive. Modern, intelligently designed security can often be made largely transparent to the user, whilst also providing the enterprise with the confidence it needs that its information is suitably managed. Where some degradation of user experience is unavoidable, a risk management analysis must consider the negative impact of users avoiding unpleasant official IT and degraded productivity. Furthermore, a transparent understanding of the mapping between official information, threat sources and capabilities, through to the required mitigations, enables informed risk management when there is a change in environment or appetite for risk. The vast majority of government’s information will fall into the lowest – OFFICIAL – tier. This OFFICIAL tier has been created on the basis of a ‘commercial threat model’, this means protecting against the type of threats faced by a large company or bank, for example cyber criminals or hacktivists intent on stealing personal or financial information or disrupting services. To defend against threats such as these, government will use only the very best security technology sourced from the commercial market, and there will be no need for any bespoke or government-only controls at this level. A small set of software will perform security enforcing functions, such as firewalling or encrypting data. Such products require assurance that they function as advertised, achieved through the CESG Commercial Product Assurance (CPA) scheme. This scheme is lightweight compared to previous schemes, reflecting the commercial grade risks for OFFICIAL information. It is the intention of the Civil Service Reform Plan and the new Security Classification Policy that there is greater emphasis on user responsibility, reducing expensive and overbearing technical controls. This requires proper training to assist users in handling sensitive information, and auditing to verify users are acting responsibly. Users should be trusted to carry out their roles and given the responsibility to do so securely. Audit and verification of user behaviour should be used to ensure policy compliance instead of preventative measures which add cost and degrade productivity. Such audit and verification should be implemented by services or network infrastructure, away from the end user device. Government should not invest in security controls to protect users from risks they can protect themselves from. Departments should however invest in security controls that help defend individual users against threats that they themselves cannot reasonably defend against. For example, government should not invest in special technology to prevent civil servants working on sensitive information in an open busy public place: users should be able to judge, assess and use appropriate risk mitigation approaches by themselves. Likewise, civil servants should be able to exercise reasonable judgment about which information is sent to external recipients by email over the public internet. This will lead to reduced technical controls and their associated costs, whilst also optimising the usability and flexibility of the IT tools for the majority of responsible users. The new security policy provides for a simpler and more meaningful approach to denoting the value of information assets and threat model. Together with a set of common controls for OFFICIAL information, it enables a more consistent, standardised, reusable and interoperable approach to securing information assets in government. There should no longer be situations where information cannot be shared between bodies solely because their interpretation of the same security guidance has led to incompatible controls. The Cabinet Office Security Classification Policy provides guidance as to which information falls into the OFFICIAL category. It is important to start thinking about security from the very start of an IT procurement project, as bolting it on later invariably introduces additional cost and delays. In fact, getting appropriate security into your system needs to start with specifying security requirements correctly in the contract. When we don’t adequately articulate security requirements for design and ongoing maintenance of a system, our suppliers price for the level of contractual risk the ambiguity introduces. Specifying security requirements of the form “must be accreditable for IL3” must become a thing of the past, as the risk appetite of departments varies and suppliers not used to working with government will struggle to find out what that means for the design and maintenance of their system - adding cost and risk to both parties. Instead, when writing IT contracts, departments should think about what they care about from an information assurance perspective and specify requirements that actually manage their concerns. As well as getting a solution that address the real business needs, this approach also allows industry to innovate to solve the security problem. It is often said that security is the reason something can’t be done. This is very rarely the case in practice - rather, security is being (mis)used as a handy excuse to not do something. Good information risk management practices allow organisations to understand the risks they are taking with their information assets, and work out the most effective ways to manage and control those risks - whilst not hindering business. If someone tells you that “Security says No”, or that “CESG say No”, you should ask for more information to learn what the risks actually are, and what techniques and tools are available to help manage those risks. Accreditation effort should always be proportional to the complexity, threat and impact of a system. It is vital that the effort spent should scale to match the challenge at hand. Can the business accept the risks of undertaking a given activity? Accreditation documentation only needs to contain the information needed to enable this decision. Clearly, any accreditation activity which just generates documentation that’s never read is not adding value, nor helping to secure information. When performed well, accreditation helps risk owners have confidence that all aspects of a system’s security have been appropriately considered, and that proper through-life security processes are in-place to maintain information security. Experience has shown that the licensing model for software is not an accurate gauge for the security of the finished item. There are very securely-developed open source projects and proprietary products. The opposite is also true. The experience and competence of those developing code is of primary importance. The same considerations should be given to the security of open source products as are applied to proprietary code. The Open Source toolkit has more information. There are three problems with this statement. Firstly, CESG don’t accredit products - they provide assurance in the security properties of products and certify them when they meet various standards. Secondly, only those products which provide a security enforcing function need to be evaluated and certified by CESG; products like switches or email servers don’t need to be CESG certified. Finally, CESG certification of a product is a component of risk management - it doesn’t absolve an organisation of their responsibilities to information security. Whilst using certified products should certainly speed up the risk management process, it isn’t mandatory. For example, for a small-scale pilot deployment it might be reasonable to take the risk of using some unassured products, but to use the experience to discuss with the developer how they will provide independent assurance in the security functions their product provides, and to require this assurance to be in-place before wider roll-out. RESTRICTED systems can be built today using assured commodity security products - many of which are found natively in the operating systems of modern platforms. In the past, some of the security controls which were recommended for protecting RESTRICTED IT systems were bespoke variants of commodity products, or were “government specials”. The requirements which drove these choices are no longer relevant given advances in commodity IT, and better approaches are available to provide an equivalent level of security, but with enhanced usability and overall cost of ownership. FOUNDATION grade assured products are appropriate for the protection of these systems, and commodity security products (including Open Source) can achieve this grade of certification. Sometimes it is obvious that attackers are going to be interested in getting hold of your sensitive information - it has clear value to someone. However, immediate financial reward isn’t the only reason government IT systems get attacked. Attackers may be disgruntled insiders, seeking to disrupt or embarrass an organisation. Attacks may come from protest groups, seeking a platform for their views. Or attacks may seek to use one system as a point to launch attacks on another - so you might not be the primary target, but might unwittingly be a conduit to them. Are you specifically being targeted? Maybe not - but your systems and internet presence probably are being attacked on a daily basis for a wide range of reasons. Asking a someone to build an “IL3 system” or to “protect at IL5” is a misuse of the Business Impact Level framework, and will generally cause confusion and an ineffective approach to securing information. Business Impact Levels are intended to help organisations to think about the consequences of certain events, and thus steer where effort should be used when managing information risks. There is no standard set of technical, procedural or personnel controls for any particular Impact Level, and so specifying requirements in terms of ILs is unclear and inaccurate. Instead, security requirements should be defined in terms of the level of protection that each information asset should be given, and expectations around its through-life protection. It is true that if you are building a system which handles many records, the impact of loss of many of them is likely to be higher than loss of one or two. Although Business Impact Levels are often misused as shorthand for protective markings, there is no direct mapping from Impact Level to protective marking. In the IL3 aggregated to IL4 example, rather than building a system capable of storing CONFIDENTIAL records, it is likely to be acceptable to simply add some simple additional controls around the data store, to reduce the risk of a bulk loss of data.","description":"Protecting information from valid threats to its confidentiality, integrity and availability is an enabler of digital services.

Service integration models have been around for some time, but are now evolving from the challenges of managing a small number of large suppliers (typically systems integrators) to a model of managing a greater number of smaller suppliers, often providing commodity services. For the model to be effective the component services need to be well defined and understood. It is important to avoid any ambiguity about the boundaries of both responsibilities and accountabilities. Key features of an effective model are: The level of service integration will differ depending on the complexity of the business services and/or customers that are being supported, and the complexity of the services that are being delivered to those businesses. As the services and businesses become more critical or complex, the level of service integration becomes deeper.  The design of the service integration function will differ by department. It may be completely operated in-house. Or it might consist of a thin in-house capability ultimately responsible for the integrated end to end operation and management of quality IT services, underpinned by outsourced integration services for specific elements - for example performance monitoring, service desk, or service level reporting. The G-Cloud framework offers a number of services to support service integration. Particularly for smaller departments and simple services, care needs to be taken not to over-engineer the service integration approach - effective use of commodity standards-based IT should mean that integration and support requirements are much less onerous than managing a locked-down bespoke system. As part of service integration, you should maintain an accurate service catalogue including a service dependency map, so that you can effectively manage changes that are high risk, high impact, or that can affect multiple suppliers. When buying in services you should retain the contractual authority to ensure suppliers follow your service integration processes - so that you can ensure the integrity and availability of a department’s user services. This could include an end to end service performance incentive model so all suppliers collectively share in the benefits and penalties of a joint performance management regime.","description":"Service integration and management enables an organisation to manage the providers of services in a consistent and efficient way, ensuring that performance across a portfolio of multi-sourced goods and services meets user needs.","link":"/service-manual/technology/service-integration.html"},{"title":"Spending controls","indexable_content":"The process What will be examined Starting the process Mapping controls to Discovery, Alpha, Beta, Live Stages greater public and market transparency and two-way engagement through publishing business needs and subsequent decisions towards a solution greater emphasis on problem exploration, solution discovery and market engagement activity before any formal procurement is initiated greater use of agile iterative development over linear waterfall delivery contracts (including contract amendments, extensions or renewals) licences expenditure through existing frameworks feasibility and/or proof of concept studies pilots projects (or an element of a project) and programmes ‘business as usual’ changes or enhancements or maintenance or refreshes common infrastructure solutions including voice and data communications, Public Services Networks (PSN) whether fixed or mobile.

Organisations should follow the rules set out in Managing Public Money which sets out the overriding principles for dealing with resources used by public sector organisations in the UK. The HMG Spend Controls supplement those rules with specific controls for spend in the following areas: Advertising and marketing and communications; Strategic Supplier Management, including disputes; Commercial models; ICT; Digital Service Delivery (including identity assurance); External Recruitment; Consultancy; Redundancy and Compensation; Learning and Development; Property and Facilities Management. A request for spend approval is likely to require a number of controls - most Digital and IT spend requests will also require Commercial Approval to ensure they are aligned to government procurement policy. Each department has a GDS account manager who will ensure that other areas of Cabinet Office are engaged as needed when considering a case. An online controls tool has been introduced to support this process and give full visibility on case progress. The purpose of the IT and digital controls is to ensure that spending on IT is proportionate and directed at programmes and projects that meet the commonly agreed Digital and ICT strategies. It is an independent confirmation that the department has undertaken thorough consideration of the user need and value for money solution options. The controls process has changed over time to ensure: GDS will examine and challenge all technology-related spending over a certain threshold - no public commitment or expenditure should be made above these thresholds without prior approval. The thresholds are: These thresholds cover all technology expenditure, including: They also cover programmes that are broken into smaller chunks or projects, which individually are below the thresholds, but which in aggregate are above them. Intentionally breaking down a programme into smaller elements to avoid the controls process is itself a serious breach of the controls. Departments should engage early with GDS to agree the appropriate points for approval, before the first approval is needed (usually after the discovery phase, at Strategic Outline Case or before a Prior Information Notice is issued).  This early engagement will avoid departments proceeding too far without approval and reduces the risk of irregular expenditure. Full details of current requirements are detailed in the Cabinet Office ICT Spend Control Form (currently V.2.18).  You can start the process by e-mailing gdsapprovals@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk. If your request contains ‘Restricted’ information it should be sent to ictspendapproval@cabinet-office.gsi.gov.uk. Note that your organisation may have established a single point of contact for engaging with GDS, so check first within your organisation. If your project cost exceeds your department’s main delegated authority set by Treasury it will be classed as a Major Project and you will also need to engage with Cabinet Office’s Major Projects Authority (MPA). A Major Project is defined as “a central Government funded project or programme that requires HM Treasury approval during its life, as set out in Delegated Authority letters”. The guidance describes the Treasury Approval process and Major Projects Assurance process including creation of an Integrated Assurance and Approval Plan (IAAP), which will document the approvals needed through the lifecycle of the project. Digital projects will also be assessed for compliance to the service standard – as described in the flowchart below:  The controls process will have slight differences if your project is following an iterative approach or a waterfall approach. All digital projects will follow an iterative approach, and you will need to engage early with GDS to define the approvals your project needs.

Those with the title of designer may have a particular focus on one or more specific design disciplines – interaction, graphic, UX – but a good digital service needs talented, flexible designers to help build user-centred products. Designers and front-end developers should work together in one team, designing in-browser. This is a better way of working, avoiding silos and ensuring that decisions are made with complete awareness of the implications. As a result, the people you hire should already have worked like this, or at least understand it. Depending on the types of project you are tackling you may require a team of designers with a range of different skills. A good first hire for a team tends to be a strong interaction designer, however adding designers with graphic design skills and designers who also have a background in undertaking user research can also give your team additional flexibility and capabilities. We strongly believe that design and user experience is the responsibility of the entire team and must be considered from the outset of the project through to and beyond going live. UX includes how fast the servers are, to how the copy is written, to how the layout is implemented in code, and what the structure of the URLs is. It’s worth looking at Frances Berriman’s talk on this. When building a team ask to see examples of work and ask the designers to explain their practical contribution. You should look for the designer to share stories and documentation that demonstrates how they have worked closely with other members of the team including developers, content designers, user researchers and stakeholders in an agile and iterative way. When evaluating their design work, it is important that the designer can explain a strong rationale for their design decision making that is based in supporting user needs. This ability to explain their rationale convincingly is more important than their ability to show polished wireframes or designs in their portfolio. Often a lack of polished designs in a portfolio can indicate that a designer is highly collaborative or has strong development skills, so take care not to focus only on polished comps or layouts. You should also ask the designer to talk about any significant differences between the design they present in their portfolio and the actual live design. It is important that designers create appropriate work and are able to persuade stakeholders and their team to make good design decisions.

They continually improve the service by identifying new tools and techniques and removing technical bottlenecks Good digital services will require code to be written, adapted, maintained and supported. A team of skilled developers will be able to make sure that happens in an efficient and transparent way, and to help continually improve the service by identifying new tools and techniques and removing technical bottlenecks. No digital service can be effectively built, delivered, owned and operated without the technical skills to understand and improve the software enabling it. In order to provide the best service to your users it is vital that you are in a position to rapidly tailor that software to their needs and to the efficient running of the underlying systems. Developers will be able to work directly on those services, but are also an important part of service innovation as they bring ideas, generate prototypes and contribute to a rounded team.  Once a service is live the need for developers continues. There will always be technical optimisations that can be made – faster and more responsive systems, acting to mitigate the risks of a constantly changing security environment – but as you respond to new or more clearly understood user needs the software will need to adapt. As the policy and other context around a service changes the software may need to integrate with new systems or provide new features and a development team can help ensure that work is pro-active. A great developer: You would expect any developer to: It’s really important that your team is clear as to who makes technical decisions. Everyone on the team will have useful knowledge, skills and experience to bring to bear and you will need an agreed way to understand that input and make a call. Some teams accomplish that by appointing a Tech Lead or delegating certain decisions to a Technical Architect, others will put that responsibility in other roles. The important thing is that clear technical decisions be made by people equipped to understand the trade-offs involved. As your team grows it is likely that you will find a range of skills and experience. You should be ensuring a balance within the team, making sure that more junior team members are well supported and coached by more experienced team members, but that everyone’s ideas are considered and engaged with by the team and its decision maker. Read guidance in the manual of particular interest to developers.

Outside government, organisations in the public and private sector are learning that empowered, experienced and highly skilled managers (often called Product Managers in the commercial world) are necessary to deliver high-quality digital services. We are adopting that model, requiring each transactional digital service handling over 100,000 transactions each year to be developed, operated and continually improved by an experienced, skilled and empowered Service Manager. These are not technical IT posts, nor are they confined to running a website. Instead, they are individuals who work full-time to develop and deliver all the changes necessary to provide effective digital services. With a handful of exceptions, this is a new role within government. These Service Managers will: This will depend on the scale of the service you are working on.  In some cases the Service Manager will also be able to fulfil the role of Product Manager - working closely with the delivery team (the ‘makers’), prioritising stories for each sprint, attending daily stand ups, being on hand to comment on solutions as they emerge, and accepting stories once they are delivered. However, in many cases it is likely that the Service Manager won’t have the capacity to be this hands-on, so they are likely to need a dedicated Product Manager. The government digital strategy requires services handling over 100,000 transactions each year to be redesigned, operated and improved by a skilled, experienced and empowered Service Manager. Cabinet Office will help departments to recruit suitably skilled individuals. Newly appointed Service Managers will be supported by GDS through a specialist training programme.

Those working in creative and technical fields often need plenty of space for focussed, detailed work. It’s not uncommon to see people spending a significant chunk of their day with headphones on to help them focus, or locked in conversation with just one person with whom they’re pairing. Equally, you might expect to see lots of short meetings throughout a day, often around walls covered in notes or reference material. These regular exchanges are important to ensure the quality of the work, but can seem strange in office cultures that are much more used to formal meetings or conference calls. The room a team works in is a tool. It is just as important as the choice of project management tools or choice of programming language. Teams should dedicate time at the beginning of a project to making sure they have everything they need and addressing any problems. This might include setting up a project wall, configuring collaboration software like email groups or project trackers, building and installing dashboards, putting up whiteboards, or simply moving desks about so the team can sit together. Removing those dividers between desks makes a big difference and allows conversation between the team to flow more freely. If large monitors are getting in the way remove them. You might also want to think about getting desk tidies like these. The difference a tidy environment makes to ability of a team to think and work is striking. This process is known as ‘hacking the environment’. This might seem like an obvious one, but teams working together to deliver a product should sit close together. Short, informal conversations are an important way to test assumptions, and this gets much harder when a team is distributed across an office, or worse, in different buildings. When working on the design, development and operation of a service it’s essential that your team be able to be in constant contact with one another to make rapid decisions, provide support and information and to ensure everyone’s aware of the project as a whole. Some of that will be achieved through regular short meetings such as a daily standup or weekly ‘show and tell’ session, but there’s also a need for an asynchronous mechanism that’s more immediate and conversational than email but that allows people to dip in and out. Internet Relay Chat (IRC) – and similar tools such as group messengers, Campfire, and so on – operate as software running on the user’s computer as a dedicated application or in a web browser, supporting a constant stream of live conversation. Typically, a user would leave the service running in the background while working on other things, switching focus when a break is needed or when you need to ask a specific question. Questions might be along the lines of: Anyone on the team would be able to respond with information, suggestions of other people to talk to, and so on. Because it is network based it will also work regardless of geography so distributed teams can continue to communicate as if they were in one room.

This is your chance to develop skills in-house, so before you go outside the civil service, first see if you have team members who can be developed into roles. If not, you can hire individuals or companies to fill in the gaps of specialist skills. GDS can help you hire some roles. We have job descriptions for: Other descriptions will be made available. Please contact the team if you have particular descriptions in mind.  GDS can give you some advice on certain candidates or interviews and setting contracts.  If you need part of a team or a complete team, remember: you are buying skills to help your team or to build your team around.

GDS can give you advice on buying this sort of capability through existing processes like G-Cloud, Spot-buy etc. Later in 2013, you will be able to use the Digital Procurement Framework. An underlying principle behind Agile development is that people are more important than process. It has been proven that great teams make great products whether they’re in government or business.  At GDS, we don’t call people ‘resources’, whether permanent or contract. You look after people, resources are things you use (and discard). Some guiding principles for service managers or delivery managers: And don’t forget, contractors can’t sign things. Suppliers and permanent staff should sit together, work together and work through problems together. The team should create an environment where difficult questions can be asked and all ideas are listened to. All team members should work to do the right thing for the user, not just what they have been asked to do. Both suppliers and permanent staff should suggest ideas and work together to identify further skills gaps and solutions to create a better product. The individual’s or company’s intention should always be to disengage from the department, leaving the team to function on its own. Your team structure and processes should centre around transferring knowledge to permanent staff, wherever possible. Don’t let a contractor become a single point of failure and treat all team members (permanent and contractors) the same.

It’s also a method service teams can use to sort and arrange user needs. The method is very simple to use: it involves simply writing the needs or topics on pieces of card (maximum of around 50) and asking representative users to organise these into groups, which are then given a meaningful label. 15 to 30 users are recommended: a minimum of 15 users will give reasonable confidence in the results, but any more than 30 gives diminishing returns. It is also possible to conduct a closed card sort, whereby the users are given pre-determined categories and are asked to allocate each card to one of these categories. Open card sorts are most suitable for identifying how users think about information, in order to build an information architecture. Closed card sorts are most suitable for validating an information architecture. The analysis of card sorting can be difficult if no clear categories emerge. It can also be difficult to conduct a card sort on a very large website with a broad scope of content (eg GOV.UK) since the maximum number of cards may not be representative of all of the content. Card sorts can also be conducted using an online tool such as OptimalSort. This is a cheap and effective way of reaching a large sample of users without needing to bring them into a dedicated lab facility for the study.","description":"Card sorting is a research method used to understand the way that the intended users of a web site naturally organise or think about different types of information or content.

More detailed guidance on each of these techniques can be found in the links below.  User research can be categorised into two broad themes – product research, and strategic research.  Product research can incorporate both qualitative, and quantitative techniques. Qualitative techniques are intensive, and often small scale. These include focus groups and 1:1 interviews, and are typically used to explore and analyse unstructured data.  Quantitative techniques involve higher-volume research, and include online surveys, face-to-face interviews, and involve a structured approach to data collection and analysis.  Product based research can be conducted in-house or via a specialist agency. In-house approaches can be quicker as they involve less lead time (eg procurement), but require skilled in-house researchers, and can involve the procurement of some specialist software. Typically agencies are only used when specialist skills/experience is required that is not available in-house, and/or the scale of the project would mean it is difficult to provide dedicated internal resource.  Strategic research also uses quantitative and qualitative methods, and is used to help understand the appetite for a product or service – typically looking at the size of the market, trends, type of users etc. Secondary data, also known as desk research, can be used, and involves the analysis of existing research or information sources. Ideally, secondary research should be conducted before embarking on any research project to understand what is already known, and what research is required to fill the knowledge gaps. This can range from published research, news article, or internal research that has been conducted previously. The table below illustrates the typical product lifecycle, showing the stages at which user research should be conducted. This chart can be used as a reference to ensure that user needs are being factored into design at every stage.  Typically this will involve some initial fact finding in the early stages to understand the user needs, including who they are, how they currently do things, how they’d like to do them, and what information is currently available.  Each service/product will have a different proportion of users who are not online and this will need to be considered when formulating an appropriate research approach for assisted digital users. The services/product will need to consider the digital skills of their users to understand which users who currently don’t use digital channels:  Some services, eg where users are large corporations, will not require assisted digital. The Digital Landscape Research contains a demographic breakdown of who is offline and online and service teams and these techniques may be useful for doing user research.","description":"This guidance provides a broad overview of the methods and techniques available to conduct user research.

Any thinking about a service, whether online or offline, must start with the question: What is the user need? Defining a user need must be strict and honest. For GDS, it’s the need the user has of government, not the need of government to impart information to the user. That’s an important distinction, because it means that you’ll be able to more measure the success of your services and iteratively improve them to meet the needs of the people who will make use of them. You need to set the boundaries of what your service can and should offer, to prevent a bottomless list of user needs. This is especially true of a government website such as GOV.UK. As well as identifying user needs, we identified which of those needs the government must answer. This led to the ‘It’s in if…’ criteria: Similar criteria may help you determine which needs you build a service to meet. Expressing a user need mustn’t imply the solution. The user need should be expressed as a user story, so the service team can discuss and explore possible solutions.

The types of community differ, and vary in openness, permanency and size. A typical community will be private, often have between 300-500 members and focus on building relationships between participants. This type of community offers a great source of deep insight over long periods of time.  The tasks given to a research community differ in format and can include; online forums, blogs, polls, surveys, instant chat and more. Tasks are usually creative, and ask different questions relating to the research objective/s. Research communities can be used for a wide range of projects such as audience understanding, diary studies, concept development or simply idea generation. They allow a business to get close to users and offer meaningful dialogue between an organisation and its customers. The key benefits are: Communities require constant management. Participants need to be kept engaged, which means daily interaction, new questions and inventive approaches to maintain their interest.  The community needs constant moderation, usually by a research manager or third party research agency. The quality of community members is paramount. Their feedback needs to be quality checked and panel attrition needs to be monitored on an on-going basis to ensure fresh ideas.  Participants can be obtained using public postings on websites, email groups and social media, or via third party sample companies.","description":"An online research community is a website that allows pre-selected respondents to interact with each other and complete a series of tasks.

These questions should be open ended, and structured in a manner that will help elicit information from respondents in a sensible flow.  As suggested by the name, discussion guides should be used as a guide to the discussion, and in comparison with a structured questionnaire, questions and areas for coverage should not read out verbatim. This enables the discussion to be led by respondents’ own experience. Typically each section of the guide would include time guidance to ensure all areas can be covered and it should also indicate when stimulus is being used, and specify participants’ tasks. Writing a discussion guide should be an iterative process, and once the initial draft has been written it is helpful to get input from other people on the project team.

The aim is to gather insight into how people live; what they do; how they use things; or what they need in their everyday or professional lives. Ethnographic research relies on techniques such as observation, video diaries, photographs, contextual interviews, and analysis of artefacts such as for example devices, tools or paper forms that might be used as part of a person’s job. Observations can be made at home, at work, or in leisure environments. People can be studied with their family, on their own, with work colleagues, or as part of a group of friends. Often one participant may be recruited, but several more may be studied as part of that person’s family or friends. Data collection can range from a 4-5 hour contextual interview, through to following a participant for several days, or even a longitudinal study over several weeks or months to investigate, for example, how a particular product or service might be used over time. It doesn’t necessarily involve ‘full immersion’ in a person’s life: it can involve a depth interview in a person’s home or it might involve a person simply maintaining their own video diary over a period of time. Ethnographic research can provide extremely rich insight into ‘real life’ behaviour, and can be used to identify new or currently unmet user needs. This approach is most valuable at the beginning of a project when there is a need to understand real end user needs, or to understand the constraints of using a new product or service by a particular audience. Ethnographic research can provide a significant amount of qualitative data, and analysis can be time consuming. NOTE: The term ‘ethnographic’ can be misused, it’s currently a bit of a ‘buzzword’ with some agencies who may not fully understand the approach.  It is recommended that a specialist agency is used, who can demonstrate successful case studies (collecting and analysing the data). In principle, anyone could participate in this type of research. As with any user research, the recruitment of suitable participants is key. The full implications of the research should be fully explained to potential participants, as some may not feel comfortable with this level of intrusion in their lives. Depending on the study needs and the approach, but 6-8 weeks from briefing to results can provide rich insight. It may take time to build trust with participants, and the analysis period needs to be sufficient to be thorough. Ethnographic research can be expensive and time consuming, but this depends on the needs of a particular project. The benefits derived can be extremely valuable.","description":"Ethnographic research usually involves observing target users in their natural, real-world setting,  rather than in the artificial environment of a lab or focus group.

An ‘expert’ usability evaluator can assess a product (or web site) against a known set of ‘heuristics’, or usability guidelines (best practice). An alternative approach is to conduct a ‘cognitive walkthrough’ against specific use cases or scenarios.   Ideally two usability experts will conduct the review independently, and then meet to discuss and agree the findings before making recommendations to the service manager. A list of widely accepted (although not necessarily validated) heuristics are provided by Jakob Nielsen or an alternative set can be found in the International Standard ISO 9241. A ‘cognitive walkthrough’ is a usability inspection that aims to identify usability issues by focusing on how easy it is for users to accomplish specific tasks with the system (or website).   This method starts with identifying the user goals, then conducting a task analysis to specify the sequence of steps or actions required to achieve each task. The usability expert, along with designers and developers, then walks through these identified steps to assess the extent to which a user can achieve their goal. Both of these approaches can be used to evaluate an existing product or website, or as a quick, low cost method of evaluating a product in development. These approaches can be considered to be ‘better than nothing’, but will never provide the same quality insight as testing with real end users. However, a competent usability specialist will often identify issues that are subsequently seen in traditional user testing or in actual use. Some agencies conduct expert reviews as the first step of all usability projects. The fundamental weakness of any expert review is that it doesn’t involve use by real end users. Some people may therefore consider this to be purely opinion, but input from an experienced usability expert is better than no user testing at all. For a simple website application this could be turned around in 1-2 days.","description":"Expert reviews - also known as heuristic evaluations - are low cost usability methods that don’t involve participation of real end users.

A focus group is normally made up of 6-12 people, although sometimes mini groups are favoured (4-5 people) as they can lead to a greater depth of discussion. 1:1 interviews are conducted by a moderator with a single respondent, and sometimes these are conducted over the phone. Interviews and discussion groups are both facilitated by a trained moderator using a specially designed topic guide in order to ensure the discussion is focused and keeps on topic. Sessions normally last 1-2 hours and will often involve participants being shown stimulus – eg communications materials to inform discussion, and sessions may include interactive techniques eg role play scenarios. Focus groups and 1:1 interviews are useful techniques for exploring and mapping reasons for attitudes and behaviour, understanding how target audiences approach issues or may be encouraged to change. They also enable participants reactions to be monitored, and the moderator to probe interesting issues when necessary. Dedicated viewing facilities are often used that enable sessions to be recorded, and interested parties can observe the sessions (often via a two way mirror) in a separate room to the participants. This often results in the research having more credibility as interested parties will have been able to view the sessions, and witness the findings first hand - this also means key issues can be acted upon quicker as observers can feed straight back to their teams. Some sessions take place in community settings, encouraging less confident/harder-to-reach audiences to attend. Focus groups can also be conducted online. The number of groups is often dictated by the budget available, but the average project will have 4 to 6 groups, with larger ones having between 10 and 20. Besides budget, other factors that influence the number of groups used are the number of potential users groups that need to be covered, and the number of geographic areas. Focus groups and 1:1 interviews can be expensive compared with other types of research, while the small samples size means that findings are not statistically significant. There is, therefore, a risk of generalising across audience groups. Analysis of the sessions can also be time consuming. Moderators also need to build a rapport with respondents. If he or she fails to do this, and can’t control the group adequately, it can result in the sessions being dominated by one or two participants, and biased data being collected.  Participants can be obtained from the general population and hard to reach groups.","description":"Focus groups, mini groups, and 1:1 interviews involve unstructured interviews or group discussion.

The term ‘guerilla’ refers to its ‘out in the wild’ style, in the fact that it can be conducted anywhere eg cafe, library, train station etc, essentially anywhere where there is significant footfall. Guerilla testing works well to quickly validate how effective a design is on its intended audience, whether certain functionality works in the way it is supposed to, or even establishing whether a brand or proposition is clear. This approach is quick and relatively easy to set up. Participants are not recruited but are ‘approached’ by those persons conducting the sessions. The sessions themselves are short, typically between 15-30 minutes and are loosely structured around specific key research objectives. The output is typically ‘qualitative’ so insight is often rich and detailed. Anyone on the service team can conduct ‘guerilla testing’ on their site or service but often the best scenario is for a researcher to run the sessions with the designer or developer. The researcher can help with defining the tasks, moderating the sessions as well as provide a level of ‘objectivity’ by not being the person who designed or built what is being evaluated. Involving the designer / developer in the sessions enables them to see first hand ‘real’ people interacting with their product, where there are areas for improvement and how they might go about resolving any issues. This approach also does away with any lengthy reporting back. Insights can be observed, taken away and fed back into the design process almost immediately. However, a brief summary with key findings and recommendations can be written up as a more formal record. It is a method that suits the ‘agile framework’ well. Guerilla testing can be used throughout the service lifecycle. As it is cheap to set up, run and report back on, it is a method that can be used frequently. There are a few logistics that should be taken into consideration before conducting any guerilla testing; Remember, whenever recording sessions you must seek permission from the participant first. Provide them with a written consent form for them to sign. The key weakness of guerilla testing as a research method it that is not statistically robust and participants may not always match your ‘target’ audience in terms of skills, expertise, knowledge. This can vary from between 6-12 participants in any given round of guerilla testing. It is very much dependent on where and when those sessions are conducted. 16 teenagers evaluated the National Citizen Service website. Sessions were conducted in the canteen of a further education college in Nottingham. Usability and editorial findings were discovered and quickly fed back to the development teams. The whole process took 2 days.","description":"Guerilla user testing is a low cost method of user testing.

From a traditional perspective, user testing measures how well participants respond in the key areas of:  This approach is combined with more ‘qualitative’ techniques to help understand the users’ motivations and attitudes as well.  A product or service is usually assessed by asking small samples of the target audience to complete specific but realistic tasks in one to one sessions. The facilitator observes how well the participants are able to complete those tasks, noting down the areas or features that cause the participant problems.  Often the facilitator will ask participants to think aloud whilst completing those tasks in order to understand their decision processes better. User testing can be conducted on low-fi assets (eg paper prototypes, wireframes) and hi-fi assets, including working prototypes and live digital services. It’s most effective when conducted early within the lifecycle of a product but can be conducted towards the end of the service lifecycle to validate any usability improvements. A lab environment can provide a more formal setting for conducting sessions, with most spaces offering viewing facilities enabling stakeholders and key team members to watch the sessions in real time.  Usability testing is best suited to finding the big issues, essentially the problems that affect users trying to perform tasks. However, it is qualitative in nature and is not statistically robust due to the small participant numbers, per round. The lab environment may also be considered a weakness. It means testing is conducted in a very different space to that a user will commonly be in. This method is not an appropriate for understanding user behaviour or user needs eg what they might want from a product or service.  Between 5-8 participants, per round of user testing is sufficient to highlight the majority of usability issues. The key is to test often.","description":"User testing is a ‘qualitative’ research method, used to gauge how easy and intuitive a (product, service, website) is to use and whether it supports the needs of its intended audience.","link":"/service-manual/users/user-research/lab-based-user-testing.html"},{"title":"A/B and multivariate experiments","indexable_content":"Further reading This article in Wired shows how A/B experiments were used to good effect in Obama’s election campaign.

They can also be useful to target hard to reach groups, who would otherwise be impossible to reach within a realistic timeframe. Respondents completing research in the shortest amount of time is a common problem, as this indicates that they have not given full consideration to the research that they are taking part in. Most panel companies reduce this prospect by monitoring how respondents complete the research (by time completion, and by the way they answer certain questions) and remove any suspicious respondents from their database. In addition to this, most panel companies will ensure that their respondents only complete four to six surveys a year.

Each session usually includes tasks being given to see how users interact with the website/online service and are followed up with a series of questions about their perceptions and how easy it was to complete the tasks. As there is no moderator present, special software is used in order to record the user’s interactions with the website/online service. While traditional lab testing focuses of gathering rich and detailed information, remote usability testing aims to test with large numbers of users and produce statistically significant results. It is recommended that remote testing is not conducted in isolation, and face to face testing is also completed. Remote usability testing can be used to test both website content, and online services. Testing content normally involves people completing task based on the online content, while online services are normally tested by asking users to complete a task using the online tool or transaction (Jobseekers Allowance, Driving Licence, etc). Success is measured on whether the user can complete the tasks/transaction.  Benchmarks on new and existing products are gathered so that completion rates (and other success measures) be collected and performance monitored. The key advantage of remote usability testing are that it: Although remote usability provides testing with large numbers of people, findings can lack depth as they focus on what people do, and not why they have done it. When testing new products the tasks can seem artificial, and this is increased when testing is conducted with a panel of users, instead of real users on a live site. Remote usability testing should not be used in isolation and it is recommended that it is used in conjunction with face to face testing with real users.  In order to test new products that are still in development it is necessary to engage an online panel in order to recruit participants.

Where standard remote usability testing focuses on large numbers, and providing statistically significant findings, this type of testing enables you to get rich, qualitative data from respondents that would normally only be possible by observing users in person. As there is no moderator present, each session is recorded via screen capture software, that records the whole session, including the user talking about what they are doing, why they are doing it, and how they feel about it etc. All interviews are conducted in one hour, with the video sessions, and the answers to the follow up questions made available immediately.

This process of collecting information from a sample is referred to as ‘sampling’ and enables researchers to understand the views, and needs of a user base, without interviewing the whole user population. Consideration needs to be given to how the sample is collected (who, how, where, when) and the size of the sample collected for each study. A large sample size can be more accurate and provide greater confidence in the data collected, however a large sample is not required for all research projects.  The sample method chosen should consider the size and scale of the project, the sub-group analysis required, and balance the robustness of the approach that with the time, money, and resource available to ensure its fit for purpose. Sampling can be a complex process to understand, but on most occasions a sample of 400-500 will be sufficient for most in-house studies - again this is dependent on the level of subgroup analysis needed and also the penetration of the target group in the population. The greater the number of population groups that need to be analysed may increase the sample size needed, as typically for findings to be statistically valid a minimum of 100 in a subgroup is required. A larger overall sample of 1000+ is normally required if findings need to be nationally representative.  This guide to sampling (PDF, 885kb) was written by the National Audit Office, and although it was first published in 2001, still provides a helpful introduction to sampling methodologies.","description":"When conducting quantitative research it is essential that all findings are statistically valid, so that there is confidence in the findings and inferences can be made from the sample to the population.

This enables positive and negative comments to be grouped so that actions can be assigned to resolve problems and issues raised by users.  Some of the free tools available can group comments very broadly, and not enable the level of granularity that enables the analysis to be useful and actionable.  Furthermore, comments can sometimes be analysed incorrectly. This is especially the case when slang is used, or phrases are not meant literally (when negative words and phrases are meant positively, or positive comment are meant ironically). This is a notoriously difficult technique for anything beyond broad statements, and requires a very large sample size both of seed (already analysed) material and of commentary from each user.

In order to increase the effectiveness of the survey, it is important to include an introduction that explains the purpose of the survey to potential respondents. Make it clear what the survey will be used for, and how it will help improve the service. As it’s unlikely that it will be possible to include monetary incentives, it’s important the introduction is worded in a manner that increases the likelihood that people will want to take part. It is also recommended that people are informed of how long the survey will take to complete as this will reduce drop out rate (people who start the survey but don’t finish). Screener questions should be placed at the beginning of surveys to ensure that the correct people take the survey eg demographic information, reason for visiting etc. Quotas may also be set so that you can control the number of people taking the survey that fall into a specific demographic group or audience type.  A typical user survey will be structured in the following manner: Surveys are normally composed of the following types of questions: Single response (these type of questions allow the respondent to select just one answer) eg: Q. What is your gender? Multiple choice questions (respondents can select more than one answer) eg: Q. Why did you visit more than one area of the site today (please tick all that apply)?

A piece of computer script is used to control the frequency at which users are invited to take part in a survey eg 1:n users will get invited to take a specific survey. In order to increase completion rates, online surveys are normally no longer than 5-10 mins in length (approximately 20 – 25 questions). Email survey – these are identical in set up and design to online web surveys, except participants are asked to complete them via an email, and not at random when they visit a website. Email surveys are often more targeted as participants can be identified by information already known about the them eg demographic, information usage etc. Face to face interviews – like telephone interviews, face to face interviews are structured and conducted by a trained moderator. Unlike other survey methods, respondents may be shown limited stimulus – eg advert, leaflet cover. website design etc. Face to face interviews also enable researchers to target respondents more easily by demographic, geographic and socio economic group. Telephone interviews – structured interviews that are conducted over the phone by a trained moderator. Telephone and face interviews are the most costly methodology and they are normally conducted via a third party agency. don’t allow much time or context for considered replies. leave room for questions to be misinterpreted have a completion bias – one common criticism is that they are only completed by people who are either very satisfied or very dissatisfied Surveys contain closed ended questions with fixed responses such as ‘yes’, ‘no’, ‘very satisfied’ to very dissatisfied’, ‘excellent’ to ‘poor’ etc, and open ended questions that allow respondents to provide verbatim responses. Surveys can be conducted either face to face by a trained moderator or through self-completion (online, postal etc.) in order to quantify thoughts/beliefs, behaviours, ownership etc. Surveys can be a relatively cheap and quick way of gathering and quantifying public opinion and monitoring change over time. Surveys can be used to size a market to find out how many people own a product, or take part in an activity eg how many people use the Internet in the UK. They can be also used to understand usage and attitudes towards a product or activity eg how often people use the Internet, how they access it, why the use it etc. Complex analysis can be also be conducted to understand key drivers of attitude/behaviour, segmentation of audiences, and trade offs between different opinions etc. Surveys provide a snapshot of opinion, and are a useful method for monitoring uptake, usage and attitudes over time. Online/email surveys are normally the cheapest method as these can be conducted in-house using inexpensive or free survey software, inviting people to take part from their own website, or using a database of email addresses.  Although surveys can be a quick and cheap manner in which to conduct user research, they often: All surveys, regardless of methodology should use a robust sample that is nationally representative or representative of an audience of interest. Most nationally representative surveys are 1,000 people or more, but can be significantly larger if there are a number of distinct user groups that are being targeted. It is important that the delivery channel used considers the target audience. For example in the recent Digital Landscape research an online and face-to-face methodology was used as online and offline audiences needed to be interviewed - an online only methodology would have excluded those who are offline, and the opinions on this audience omitted from the research It is also important to note that reaching hard-to-reach groups can be more time consuming and costly (eg BME, people with disabilities).","description":"Surveys contain closed ended questions with fixed responses such as ‘yes’, ‘no’, ‘very satisfied’ to very dissatisfied’, ‘excellent’ to ‘poor’ etc, and open ended questions that allow respondents to provide verbatim responses.","link":"/service-manual/users/user-research/user-research-surveys.html"},{"title":"User research tools","indexable_content":"Survey tools Remote user testing tools Card sorting tools Online focus groups Community groups Text analysis tool    Please note: Examples are illustrative, rather than recommendations, and we suggest checking G-Cloud regularly to see if any similiar services are available using that framework.  There are number of good tools that can help user research teams conduct in-house research quickly and effectively. Below is a high level overview of what these enable, for people unfamiliar with user testing. Online tools are a good way in which to conduct in-house research cheaply and effectively. Conducting research in-house enables user research teams get closer to the data, and have a good understanding of the user. This is, however, dependent on teams having adequate resource to enable analysis to be conducted properly and fed back to the relevant teams. Please note: Examples are illustrative, rather than recommendations, and we suggest checking G-Cloud regularly to see if any similiar services are available using that framework. These enable the easy creation of online surveys. Features include ascripting tool that allows easy creation of different question types, the ability to add branding, advanced branching, automated reporting, automatic activation/pop script, email links etc.  Some good tools are available free, however, these often have restrictions on the number of questions you can ask, the number of completes you can collect, and advance features such as API, and branding. Examples include Survey Monkey, Survey Expression, Smart Survey and Fluid Surveys. These tools enable user research teams to conduct remote usability testing in-house. These tools allow you to script the surveys easily, while also conduct the analysis to be conducted relatively simply and quickly.  Most of these tools also enable you to conduct standard online surveys within the same software package. Examples include Keynote Webeffective, and User Zoom. These tools enable user research teams to conduct online card sorting in-house. Card sorting tools usually come as part of a larger survey package. Examples include User Zoom and Optimal Workshop. Enable in-house research teams to conduct focus groups online. Most also enable you to run 1:1 sessions, auto ethnography, diary studies, and micro communities. Examples include LiveMinds and VisionsLive. Enables in-house research team to manage a community of users and/or stakeholders. These normally come part of a larger online research tools package. Examples include LiveMinds and Bloomfire. Enables the analysis of large amounts of written feedback - via email, helpdesk etc. This software enables you to sort user feedback into themes, and make it easier to action.
