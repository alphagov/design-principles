That audience includes users who access the service via a range of assistive technologies like: It’s important to consider a range of disabilities when you are testing any product or service, including those with: The Equality Act 2010 came into force in 2010 and is intended to stop discrimination against members of society who may be unfairly treated due to age, disability, race, religion or sexual orientation. You have a duty to make adjustments for disabled persons so that they’re not excluded from your service, making every reasonable attempt to provide access. The Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) has a useful guide to the UK law and how it affects the accessibility of your site or service. Most accessibility testing is typically done after an accessibility audit has been conducted. If a participant has a range of needs it’s best to do accessibility testing in the participant’s own home. This is because: It’s often difficult to carry out accessibility testing early on in the process of service design. Your service must be fairly stable for it to be evaluated by people using assistive technologies, eg a screen reader will read out the contents of a web page, so the code needs to be well structured. Only do accessibility testing when: Full lab-based accessibility testing is not necessary for every project. An accessibility audit may be a more efficient and cost-effective way to review your service, depending on your typical user needs. Accessibility audits are an alternative to standard accessibility testing. An accessibility audit involves an accessibility expert reviewing your site or service, highlighting all accessibility issues and making recommendations for fixing them. They would typically use assistive software used by disabled web users (eg a screen reader) to effectively carry out the audit. See the W3C accessibility guidelines for further information. Accessibility audits are cheaper and quicker than accessibility testing, but rely primarily on the expertise of the person doing them. Include disabled participants as part of a wider user testing recruitment process. The numbers will be small, but aim to capture a range of disabilities and assistive technologies. Disabled participants are a harder to reach audience, so the cost of recruiting participants can be relatively expensive. Recruit participants through specialist organisations or agencies like the RNIB. Expect costs to increase if: Timings will vary, eg whether sessions are lab-based or structured in a ‘home environment’, but generally: These estimates are dependent on your project’s scope, and the availability of testing assets.","description":"Accessibility testing is very similar to usability testing, in that it is about making sure that a product or service is easy for its intended audience to use.

Your service should be tested by disabled people, older people, and people who use assistive technologies. You should aim to do this at least twice as your service is developed. Find out more about how to conduct accessibility testing We work hard to make our sites and services as accessible and usable as we can for everyone who needs to use them. The GOV.UK website doesn’t include a separate accessibility statement, however, as we aren’t comfortable with a statement that draws a distinction between accessibility and any other aspect of best practice development. This blog post by GDS accessibility expert Léonie Watson explains in more detail why we took this decision. Your service should be usable by recent versions of these screen readers: Your service should also be usable by basic operating system screen magnifiers like: Your service should be usable by speech recognition software including Dragon Naturally Speaking, and native operating system speech packages. HTML is quicker, easier and more widely usable/accessible than PDF, but where no other option is possible this PDF guidance should be followed. There’s more information on choosing appropriate formats. Accessibility is more than checking the boxes of standards compliance. When writing content, consider what information would be useful to people with access needs. For instance, in a ‘find my nearest’ service, consider user needs like:  You can read more about the accessibility testing we’ve carried out while building GOV.UK on this blog post by GDS Accessibility Lead Joshua Marshall.","description":"The services we provide are for the benefit of all citizens of the United Kingdom.

It will also help you to prepare for the service assessment as it lists questions and prompts that can be raised in assessments. This guidance is given in tandem with the definitions and parameters laid out in Assisted digital - information for service managers. There are 4 service design phases: discovery, alpha, beta and live. An assessment will take place: We’ve put together this checklist to help you keep track of information you’ll need as you develop your assisted digital support. During this phase you must develop a high-level understanding of assisted digital user needs, user numbers and what assisted digital support for your service might look like. You should develop a plan to answer these questions: For more information and tools on how to conduct research and testing with your assisted digital users, see GDS’s guidance on assisted digital user research. Some services may not have to provide assisted digital support, as explained in the section on assisted digital information for service managers. You’ll need to carry out research and gain evidence of this to explain it in the alpha review. In alpha, your objective is to learn the needs of your assisted digital users and then design assisted digital support that meets those needs. You then test this model during the beta. You’ll need to show evidence of meeting your key performance indicators (KPIs) before going live, so plan on how to measure your service. During the alpha stage, you should carry out research to gain understanding of your assisted digital users’ current abilities, confidence and barriers to completing your service independently. For more information and tools on how to conduct research and testing with your assisted digital users, see GDS’s guidance on assisted digital user research. This review takes place before the service can move to beta, and may cover the following questions and prompts: 1. What user research have you conducted with assisted digital users and what have you learnt that will inform the design of your assisted digital support? As the service manager, you must be able to: 2. What are your plans to test, measure and iterate your assisted digital support during beta? You must be able to explain how you will test, measure and iterate your assisted digital support during beta. Your testing must be with assisted digital users going through the end-to-end user journey. This includes identity assurance. 3. Will your assisted digital support be sustainably funded and free to the user? You must be able to explain how you plan to ensure assisted digital support is sustainably funded (including support not delivered by government) and free to the user. During alpha, you need to plan on how you’ll make sure that assisted digital support is in place for the entire user journey. This includes times when the user has to visit a third party site for identity assurance, such as GOV.UK Verify. Think about how this could affect or overlap with other central government transactions during their identity assurance. For example, talk to service managers of [exemplar services] in your department and other service managers in the service manager community to discuss what they are doing in this area. You must make sure that sustainable assisted digital support is in place for all users who need it and that no one is excluded from using the service on the basis of cost. You need to make sure that assisted digital support is sustainably funded, including support provided by friends, family, and support not funded by the department, eg: In beta, you need to thoroughly test your end-to-end assisted digital support. This will help you to gain accurate metrics and measurements. The beta phase has 2 distinct stages: When your digital service is in public beta, you must test your support on the entire scope of your service’s assisted digital users. Learn more about how to conduct research and testing with your assisted digital users. The beta assessment will decide whether a service is ready to move to public beta. To meet the Digital By Default Service Standard requirements to move to beta on the GOV.UK domain, the service manager must be able to talk about and evidence how they have built on their work and evidence from the discovery, alpha and private beta phases. A beta assessment may cover the following questions and prompts: 1. What user research have you conducted with assisted digital users during the beta, and what have you learnt? You must be able to explain: 2. How many transactions and what costs are you expecting when live for your assisted digital support? You must be able to give details for each relevant channel (eg web chat, telephone, face by face on the high street and face by face as outreach/home visit) and by provider (including non-department), including: 3. How will the assisted digital support you are putting in place meet user needs? Explain how the following elements of the service’s assisted digital support are designed to meet user needs: 4. How will you test your assisted digital support and use feedback to iterate your assisted digital support during the beta? You must be able to explain the thinking and decisions behind plans for testing your assisted digital support, including how you will: You need to show an understanding of the cost of providing assisted digital support for your service. You can do this by working out the cost per minute of providing each support channel. This makes it possible to compare costs across channels. Costs should include and exclude specifics as listed in the page on measuring cost per transaction. You should also exclude free or sub market-value support (eg given by volunteers), as it’s not sustainable. Your research into your users’ needs should also tell you what other government services they are using. Consider how their use of those services might connect with your service. You should then make sure that the user journey is consistent and joined up, where relevant and possible. You must give your users training or guidance to help them complete transactions on their own in the future. This may include: * making it easy for assisted digital users to find digital skills training opportunities * running assisted digital support in such a way as to build the user’s skills and/or confidence (eg allow the user to see the screen during in-person support or reassure and encourage them to try completing the service themselves) For more information on digital inclusion, read the Government Digital Inclusion Strategy. Your assisted digital support meets your users’ needs, but this is not the end of the process. You need to continuously improve your assisted digital support based on analytics, user feedback, and user research. You’ll repeat the development phases (discovery, alpha, beta and live) for smaller pieces of work, as the service continues to run. You’ll find something that needs improvement, research solutions and make iterations. This takes place during the beta phase and ensures the service is ready to go fully live on a GOV.UK domain. To meet the requirements for live, you must be able to show how you have built upon each phase - from discovery to alpha to the beta phases. A live assessment may cover the following questions and prompts: 1. How did you test and iterate your assisted digital support in beta, in response to user research and performance measurement? You must be able to: 2. Can you explain how the assisted digital support you are putting in place meets user needs? You must be able to explain how the design of the following elements of each channel of the service’s assisted digital support are meeting user needs: 3. How many transactions are you expecting and how much does your assisted digital support cost? You must be able to: 4. How will you measure the performance of your assisted digital support in live, including user satisfaction and a decrease in the number of assisted digital users? You must be able to explain how you will measure the performance of your assisted digital support, including user satisfaction and decrease in the number of assisted digital users. 5. How will you iterate your assisted digital support in response to user testing and feedback when the service is live? You must be able to explain your plans to iterate your assisted digital support once the service has gone live. Your user testing must show that users who need assisted digital support are aware of it and can access it easily. You should point users towards a needs assessment to check their eligibility for assisted digital support. This maximises digital take-up by making sure that assisted digital support is only given to users who really need it. Basic information about assisted digital support should be visible and clear to the user. It should also be shown in places where they already go for support, including through existing communication channels and on the service’s GOV.UK start page. Assisted digital support should promote the digital service and not be marketed or promoted. This means that digital take-up will be encouraged. You must be able to show, from user research, that your service’s assisted digital support is easy for users to access, at appropriate times and places. This could mean having phone line or in person support available in the evening, and that users report acceptable wait times for an appointment or for their call to be answered. For more information and tools on how to conduct research and testing with your assisted digital users, see GDS’s guidance on assisted digital user research. You should be able to measure the performance of your assisted digital support. This should include measuring support provided by third party suppliers, and payment by results where relevant. Measurements should include user satisfaction and a decrease in the number of assisted digital users. You should incentivise suppliers to improve both of these measurements, where relevant. This enables you to demonstrate on your Performance Platform dashboard that your service’s assisted digital support is working effectively, and to look out for signs of where improvements could be made.","description":"This guidance aims to help service managers develop good assisted digital support.

Each project features many challenges, and in your alpha you will start exploring solutions for these. You may need to bring more developers and designers into the team, who will help you to build and test prototypes and possible solutions for your users needs. By the end of the alpha you should have a clear idea of what’s required to build a beta. The whole phase should not last longer than about 6 to 8 weeks. The objective is to build a working prototype. This will be used by stakeholders or a closed group of end users to: Continue to build upon and analyse the research you have commissioned on user needs and use this to set up an open, engagement process with your stakeholders. Involve a wide range of stakeholders from the private, voluntary and other parts of the public sector. Run a series of workshops with these stakeholders to develop your options. Following demonstration of your alpha, you may choose to discard the code and start fresh in the beta. If, however, your code is effective you may continue to iterate against your prototype. Develop options for the assisted digital support for your service. To help develop the options, continue to build upon and analyse the research you have commissioned on user needs. Bring in the expertise of organisations working with people who are offline and users themselves. Run workshops to develop your options. The alpha doesn’t need to be a complete, end-to-end transaction. You’re looking to demonstrate just enough so users gain some understanding of the service. Think of it as a proof of concept: If not, find out more and make a new prototype. The alpha phase is another relatively short phase. At GDS, we try to limit these to about 2 months, running in week-long sprints over a 6 to 8 week period. This phase involves a relatively small core team, who will be capable of rapidly iterating solutions. It will probably expand and contract in size as different specialisms are required. This core team will be a mix of stakeholders, and makers (designers and developers) particularly those familiar with user research. It will be led by the service manager.

Blog post by Morgan Brown with a good discussion on user flows and conversion funnels There are various web analytics tools available to help you measure how people are using your service. Be sure to assess how well a particular tool meets your needs before deciding on which tools to use. It’s essential that your chosen analytics tools provide an open Application Programming Interface (API) with no restrictions on exporting data. Also, when deciding which analytics tool is most appropriate for your service, consider: For each of these criteria, identify which ones are fulfilled as part of the standard quoted package and what is charged for any additional features. The privacy and security of data is of absolute importance, so review your vendor’s privacy and security policy. Make sure your analytics solution and processes: As part of keeping your users’ data secure, find out: There are many digital/web analytics vendors in the marketplace, along with open source solutions. A search for ‘analytics tools comparison’ provides a number of useful resources where you can compare the capabilities and strengths of different services. See some more examples. Install and configure analytics tools that meet your needs. Where possible, use platforms that enable the data to be piped automatically into other systems. Use APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) as they will stop you from having to input data manually and allow the grouping of data across multiple platforms. You will need to answer the following: Sites that provide vendor comparison information: Sites that provide information on digital analytics: Sites that provide information on funnels (important for transactions):","description":"There are various web analytics tools available to help you measure how people are using your service.

When building an API there is always a danger of building the wrong thing in the wrong way for the wrong people. This is especially a risk in the absence of a developer community driving the needs behind the API. The simplest way to ensure your API is useful and consumable is to build a website using your own API. Building a website leads to considering how to best model content and data in terms of bookmarkable resources, and ensures data is presented in human as well as machine-readable representations. Becoming a consumer of your own APIs not only validates your API, but exposes services on the web. Consider an API to be a part of a website. Provide links to machine-friendly formats from human readable pages, and enable agents to easily construct URLs which link to human-friendly representations of pages. Use standard formats for content, and follow established web patterns for authentication. Building a service to enjoy mass adoption and support from a wide, disparate community of developers and programming environments while being able to reach a worldwide audience is difficult. While proprietary and open technologies abound for machine-to-machine communication, none of them have the web’s interoperability, reach and ability to scale. Standards are powerful agreements, and nowhere are agreements more quickly established and adopted than on the web. Using HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and URLs (uniform resource locator), the core technologies of the web, along with emergent standards such as JSON and OAuth changes a website from a retail shop window into a wholesaler, meeting our design principle to build digital services, not websites. Expose data as a set of resources, offering a clean URL for each thing, and each collection of things. Only use query strings for URLs with unordered parameters like options to search pages. Consider creating URLs for different granularity of resources. For example, /members.json could return a list of names, whilst /members.json?detail=full could return detailed information about each member in a list. These principles enable network effects which arise through linking and allow information published beyond the web, sent in alerts email, SMS, XMPP and other messages, to link back to the canonical content on the web. Ensure all HTTP GET requests are safe and actions which change state are conducted using a POST, PUT or DELETE method. Use PUT and DELETE with caution, as they are commonly blocked by firewalls, intranet proxies, hotel Wi-Fi and mobile operators: always offer a POST alternative. Avoid HTTP methods which are not well defined, such as PATCH. Offer content for each thing as a human-readable HTML, with links to content in alternative machine-readable representations: Where possible, also offer other formats most suited to a specific domain, such as: This advice builds on our more general guidance on data and content publication formats. Include hyperlinks to alternative representations as link headers as well as in content. Consider also encoding metadata inside HTML content using semantic markup: Microformats, RDFa or schema.org. The representations supported by an API for input will vary depending upon the complexity of the action, but where possible should include application/x-www-form-urlencoded to allow the construction of simple POST forms. Use names for fields, formats and path segments in a URL path consistently across your API. Establish conventions others may easily follow and anticipate. Where possible, reuse names widely used elsewhere on the web, as with the Microformats naming policy. Building a website which exposes the data through links, and services through HTML forms encourages exploration and leads to discovery through hypertext. Provide documentation for your API using examples. Collect how people are using your API, especially link to any open source projects for projects, wrappers and programming language libraries. Provide simple ways to experiment, as with The Guardian API explorer. Be clear in the web pages and other documentation as to the security, availability, rate-limiting, expected responsiveness of the platform and the provenance of data, so consumers can plan their commitment to using your API. Lower the barriers to others using your data: don’t demand registration or API keys for public data. Open data increases the number of people able to use your data and service, and leads to feedback loops where consumers become motivated to resolve issues at source, feeding back issues and correction to your service and its data. Where content is sensitive, or requires authentication, use HTTPS encryption (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) and a standard authentication such as basic authentication or OAuth, depending upon the sensitivity of your content. Build for forwards compatibility by gracefully handling content that is unexpected. The robustness principle – Postel’s Law – explains the ability for the web and internet to evolve, though you shouldn’t ignore protocol errors, corrupted, or invalidly formatted content. Preserve backwards compatibility with existing consumers of your API, by sending expected fields and employing sensible default values for missing fields. Eschew changes to the semantics of content, eg don’t change a title field from meaning the title of the page, to meaning the prefix for a name to the person’s job title. Where a revolutionary change is unavoidable, communicate a breaking change by changing the URL. When changing URLs, continue to honour old consumers, possibly use a redirection. Cool URIs don’t change. Don’t do everything yourself (you can’t). Sometimes the functionality your service needs will be provided by other parts of your organisation, other government departments or by reliable third parties via APIs. Most modern digital services are built on top of a wide range of APIs. This allows each part of the service to focus on its core responsibility rather than constantly reinventing the wheel. When consuming APIs you should be careful to keep the integration with your code clean and distinct. This is important to ensure that you can swap between providers or update to new versions of an API without making substantial changes to your core code. At GDS we encourage the use of adapter code that’s entirely focused on interfacing with the system and mapping code. This will provide the linkage between your code’s domain model and the concepts and services provided by the API. You should consider carefully how you intend to test your integration with the service. In day-to-day development you’ll want to be able to test your code without making (computationally or potentially financially) costly calls out to third party services, so you should come up with a way of providing mock versions of those APIs. For full system tests, however, you’ll want to test the full flow including the third-party service so an automated mechanism should be built for that. Many of the GOV.UK publishing applications send emails to provide alerts for content designers. When running tests we don’t want to send lots of fake emails so we swap the normal email adapter for one that logs the emails it would have sent. This lets us test our code is doing the right thing without depending on external services. Parts of our Performance Platform code involve significant interactions with Google Analytics. It wouldn’t be practical to test this by sending events to Google, waiting for them to be processed, and then reviewing the results. Our developers therefore built a mock service that can be run alongside tests and provides a dummy version of Google’s API that lets us check the right data is being sent. Our publishing systems make use of a single sign-on service. In most of our tests the interaction with that service are mocked so the applications’ tests can be run in isolation, but we also have a suite of smoke tests that run in our preview environment and use dummy accounts to ensure that the full authentication and authorisation flow is working. The Licence Application Tool integrates with a number of third-party payment services. It makes use of test accounts with those services to verify it is able to communicate with them and is sending the right data to complete payments. By depending on a third party API you could very easily be tying your service’s availability to that of the third party. In some cases that may be acceptable, but often you will want to ensure that you have a fallback plan in place. The details of that fallback will vary according to your service. It may be that you’ll need to offer the user the opportunity to use an alternative service, or queue the action to take place later. That could be an automated queue with software that monitors it and retries transactions, or it could be a manual queue where someone follows up to collect further details. You should be clear with your users about what’s happening. If a third-party payment provider isn’t available you might queue the transaction to try again later. That will mean you can’t offer users the same guarantee that their payment will be processed correctly and you should tell them so.","description":"Martha Lane Fox’s report called for government to act as a “wholesaler, as well as the retail shop front, for services and content by mandating the development and opening up of Application Programme Interfaces (APIs) to third parties.”","link":"/service-manual/making-software/apis.html"},{"_type":"manual_section","organisations":["government-digital-service"],"manual":"service-manual","title":"Government Service Design Manual: Technology architecture","indexable_content":"Architecture is not just about the design and deployment of technology – to be successful you need to consider the utility, sustainability and attractiveness of the system as a whole.

You can gain a detailed understanding of your assisted digital users and their needs by carrying out lots of user research. This also means learning how to plan and test your assisted digital support and how to make sure that users know where to go for help. An assisted digital user is someone who can’t use a digital government service independently. This includes people who are offline with no digital skills, and people who are online but only have limited digital skills. Every service has different proportions of assisted digital users. During the discovery and alpha stages, you need to: Start by looking at who currently uses the offline channels for your service and then map out where people go for help. This help could range from general enquiries to specific questions on things like eligibility or form filling. It may include help provided by: Look at which of your users access these sources of help and find out why. You can then use this information to work out how many of these users will need assisted digital support. You should also look at existing management information about your service, such as user data, transcripts and user feedback from your contact centres. Find out whether your department or service has carried out any recent research (qualitative or quantitative) on your users. Look through it to find out if it can provide any insights about who your users are and who faces barriers to going online. Add to any existing insight with new, targeted research so you can find out more about your assisted digital users and their needs. You need to find out if your users lack: To recruit suitable users for your research, you should talk to people and organisations who already help your users, such as: You should also consider employing the services of user research recruitment agencies to recruit to a specific but relevant research brief. You may need to explain your recruitment specification at your beta assessment against the Service Standard. Speak with staff and volunteers, as well as end-users of your service, and make sure researched users have either no or low digital skills. It’s also important to do your research in places where vulnerable users will feel more comfortable. This might be a library, community centre, religious centre and places where support groups meet. You, or any agency you use, must use offline methods for your research, as online methods aren’t suitable for users with no or low digital skills. Additionally, ethnographic research is more suitable for hard to reach and vulnerable users than lab-based research. Research methods that work well with assisted digital users include: Learn more about user research techniques and research methods. You can also find more information on user research surveys, including survey design and survey sampling methodologies. By the end of the alpha stage, you’ll need to have a plan ready for testing your assisted digital support before your service moves to GOV.UK. As you gather more data and insight about your assisted digital users, you also need to build up an understanding of their levels of digital skills by mapping them onto the digital inclusion scale. You must also use the digital inclusion scale to understand how difficult your digital service is to complete during each stage of development. GDS has published an initial analysis of how complex the exemplar services are. We considered criteria like how long the service takes to complete on average and how easy the service is to use on a mobile device. The analyses are published here - you should refer to them to help you analyse the complexity of your own service. Using your data and insight, create user personas that represent your assisted digital users. User personas allow you to look at the journey of each assisted digital user through your digital service. This makes it easier to work out which parts of your digital service these users find difficult or impossible to complete and why. We’ve created 8 user personas that represent people who need help to use government services online. The personas are based on desk and field research and represent real-life stories. The users were vulnerable people who needed urgent help using a variety of government services: Your service-specific personas, along with these examples, will help you to write good user stories on what your users need and why. This means you’ll understand any specific user needs, including which channels will work best for them. You must use these needs to create your plan for assisted digital support. You must test your plan with real assisted digital users when your service is in the early stage of beta. You must then continue to test your assisted digital support and gather user insights once your service has moved to GOV.UK. You need to: This will help you to provide evidence that your service will meet user needs, is high quality and provides good value for money. Use this feedback to iterate the assisted digital support and continue to ask for feedback from users, providers and experts. This will make sure the support meets user needs throughout the beta and live phases. You must share your findings with GDS and other service managers. For your service to go live, you must have evidence showing that the users who need help are aware of the support and can easily find it. It should be clear and easy to see that there is support available, but not be marketed or promoted - this helps to encourage digital take-up. In the first instance, you need to point users towards a needs assessment to check their eligibility for assisted digital support. Information about the availability of support (eg phone line numbers and opening hours, or office locations and opening hours) must encourage people to use the online service. You should provide this information in places where assisted digital users already go for help and advice, through existing communication channels with users, and on the service’s start page on GOV.UK. The language you use must be simple and clear. With real users, test the wording and design of your physical messaging (eg posters, banners and leaflets) and the content on GOV.UK. Use their feedback to improve and iterate on your messaging.

They should engage early with the service manager and people who govern. The Digital by Default Service Standard is a set of criteria that has to be met by all new or redesigned transactional government services.  Services with more than 100,000 transactions per year are assessed by the Government Digital Service (GDS). Services with under 100,000 transactions a year are assessed by a team within their own department.  Assessments happen at 3 points in the development of a service: This is an assurance and approval process: if the GDS assessment panel doesn’t pass a service, it won’t be awarded the standard or appear on GOV.UK. After an assessment, the panel provides feedback to the service team, including about where they might need to improve in order to meet the standard. Teams can use the criteria in the standard and the service manual to help focus and prioritise their work. If assurers from within the organisation are available, they can also use the service standard as a basis for their review activities. Under Cabinet Office spend controls GDS assures all technology related spending over published thresholds. You should speak to GDS early on to agree appropriate points for approval and to get advice on shaping your expenditure request.  The Major Projects Authority (MPA)  provides independent assurance on major projects, which are defined as those which: The MPA assures projects through Gateway Reviews or Project Assessment Reviews. Gateway Reviews take place at significant points during a procurement process, whereas Project Assessment Reviews are bespoke, focussed and timed to meet the specific assurance needs of your service.  The National Audit Office (NAO) audits most public sector bodies in the UK and produces value for money reports on the implementation of government policies, which could include your service. The NAO also publishes reports on good practice to help government improve public services. In recognition of the growing importance of Agile delivery of digital services, the NAO published a report in 2012 on governance for Agile delivery, drawing on experiences of governance in the private sector.

This includes the 25 exemplar services. The department or agency that owns the service must make sure it meets and maintains the standard, whether or not it is designed, built and operated by teams which are in-house, external or mixed. For services that process (or are likely to process) over 100,000 transactions a year, you will demonstrate the service and answer questions from a GDS panel. Services should be assessed at least three times before going live: You must show that the service and team have met the standard. The panel will apply common sense and a degree of flexibility to their assessments, giving teams feedback and help on how to improve a service when it looks like it won’t meet the standard.

A GDS-trained assessor will lead the assessment. An assessor or panel from the department will review the service with you and report back to the responsible digital leader who will certify the service. Publishing good, frequent information about how services are being built is really important. It not only demonstrates commitment to meeting the standard, but also: Use a public blog to collect and publish progress. Publishing means that people from inside and outside government can follow the development of a service, allowing teams to quickly get advice and test their assumptions with a wider community. It also means that there is a published audit trail of progress to support the decisions of the panel. Redesigning or transforming a service should take 18 to 24 months, though there are no fixed deadlines for meeting the standard. As a result, having feedback throughout the process is really important, reducing the risk of lengthy projects going off track. To do this, and support agile design, progress against the standard will be monitored as part of spending control processes. Departments currently need Cabinet Office approval for digital spending. To simplify this, a dedicated account manager will work with each department to help prioritise their projects. When a department makes a submission to their account manager for spending approval on services within the scope of the standard, GDS will assess whether the work completed so far meets the standard. If the service redesign or build is at an early stage, GDS will make meeting the standard a condition of approval. If the service redesign or build is at an advanced stage, GDS will make recommendations for additional spending to meet the standard. GDS will state when the team should return for further approval. A team will go through this process to unlock spending approval at each phase of a service. The public blog will be used to record progress, which will help GDS to give departments support and feedback on whether they are on track to meet the standard well ahead of an assessment.","description":"All services within the scope of the standard will be assessed against the criteria of the standard.

Updates can be as short as you like, allowing you to tell readers about subtle changes to a service’s design or new features added to a tool, while also offering you a platform for longer pieces of writing that describe significant changes to policy or approach. The Inside GOV.UK blog and the MOJ Digital blog are great examples of how teams are already talking about their work in the open. A good blog post can do the work of dozens of emails. Finding the right way of sharing a piece of information once – describing a change to how a feature works for example, or talking about upcoming work – can save a huge amount of effort in finding new ways of saying roughly the same thing. More importantly, it means there’s a consistent frame of reference for talking about a subject. If people have been told slightly different things then they might come away with a different understanding of how something works – not something likely to make your life simpler, clearer and faster. Whatever you’re writing about, make sure the most important information is in the title and the opening sentence. Readers may only see the summaries of your posts on the home page, or their feed reader, or in the email alerts, and it’s important they have a clear understanding of what you’re doing. Short updates can still go into a bit of detail about what you’re doing and why you’re doing it, whether that’s changing the colour of a button or re-writing a whole section of guidance. Keeping posts short makes them simpler to write, and also means it’ll be easier to get input from the people you work with. Though the frequency with which you blog will often vary you should aim to publish a new post at least once a week. A well-chosen illustration or photo can add important context or information for your readers. The GOV.UK blogging platform is fairly flexible. You can embed tweets, slide decks and videos as well as images, all media that make your message just a little bit easier to comprehend. The GOV.UK content design guidance is an invaluable tool for writers. They’re full of carefully researched tips for clear, concise prose which seeks to make your writing easier to understand. In particular, make use of subheadings and bullet points within your blog posts to make them quicker to read. And make use of the ‘words to avoid’ list – it’s there to make sure writers stay clear no matter the audience. The style guide doesn’t mean you can’t be warm, candid or personal. You should be all of these things. It’s important that you’re accountable for the things you write.

For starters, they’ll probably spot a few mistake that have slipped your notice, but they might also be able to offer a different perspective on the things you’re writing about.","description":"Blogs are a simple, effective way of keeping a record of the work a team is doing on a service.","link":"/service-manual/communications/blogs.html"},{"_type":"manual_section","organisations":["government-digital-service"],"manual":"service-manual","title":"Government Service Design Manual: Browsers and devices","indexable_content":"Verified browsers Developing universally accessible services Continuous compatibility Further reading Desktop Small screen devices Audience operating system browser browser version screen size/resolution mobile device Services should be universally accessible, regardless of how the user is choosing to access them. Due to the large range of browsers, devices and screen sizes available, users’ experience of your service will vary according to the technical capabilities of their browsers and devices. You must verify that your service works across a representative range of these browsers and devices. Creating your service with web standards in mind will give it the best possible chance of working across all devices. These are the browsers we recommend testing on when developing your service.  This list strongly recommends testing on a range of browsers created within the last 3 years that cover the largest representation of the user base. The list is based upon usage statistics for GOV.UK and represents approximately 95% of the most popular browsers (the remaining browsers are individually insignificant). Browsers not listed may still work well, and it should be noted that this is not a list that intends to suggest that these are the only browsers the service will work on – this is simply a benchmark for testing against to ensure that the service will likely work for as many users as possible alongside appropriate cost-effectiveness and development overhead. Services should ensure there’s an obvious way for users to report problems they may find, and additional testing and adjustments should be made upon receiving such a report. Note: An exception is made for IE6, as this is still in large-scale use in government departments. Two distinct levels of support are given and denoted next to each browser. Where ‘latest version’ is listed, it means the latest stable version plus one version back, as these browsers regularly update without intervention from the user. Digital by default services must take into consideration the limitations of the browsers people use to access them. One important idea for achieving this is progressive enhancement. This recognises that different bits of technology have different capabilities. While everybody gets access to core functionality, those using more sophisticated technology get an enhanced experience. Progressive enhancement is also important in providing a consistent experience to people using mobile devices or those who may have limited bandwidth. Because mobile traffic now accounts for 17% of all internet use in the UK over the last year and 20% of traffic to GOV.UK, this mode of access is not an optional extra to consider. Where we might previously have developed separate mobile and desktop versions of a service, or bought bespoke apps, design should now be done with one website in mind. This should be done using a responsive design approach. This means websites adapt to suit the dimension of the screen being used to view it. Don’t try to build services for every possible combination of operating system and browser. Avoid the temptation of designing for the obvious without first researching your users. Every service has an audience and you should investigate yours to see whether it has particular characteristics that you need to be aware of. Do you have existing data for the browsers and devices that your audience has been using already? If so, analyse it to see if you can identify any patterns in usage, or any combinations of: This data may sometimes support the case for deprioritising certain development work. Although most of GOV.UK is designed to work across all screen sizes, the Trade Tariff team chose not to tailor their tool to the smaller screen as it is largely used by office workers working during office hours. Equally, if your audience is likely to include those working in the public sector, there may be higher use of older, more limited browsers. Channel shift means you must also consider your potential future audience. Device data for GOV.UK is displayed on the Performance Platform and this will be expanded to include operating system and browser data. Before the launch of GOV.UK we noted a marked difference between the existing non-government and government audiences so you should also investigate the data provided by NetMarketShare and GlobalStats who can provide UK and global trends. It’s important to distinguish between those browsers and operating systems whose popularity is either increasing or holding steady and those for which the opposite is true. Although Internet Explorer versions 6 and 7 are only used by a minority (2.5% of visits to GOV.UK in the last year) this still accounts for a significant number of individuals that government services must take into account. However, over time this will change. So it’s important to set thresholds for abandoning support and for adopting new and emergent platforms. The iPad Mini, Kindle Fire, Windows 8 and Internet Explorer 10 highlight this dilemma – recently launched products might not appear in any data but it is likely that they’ll eventually enjoy widespread use. Decisions about compatibility can’t be something you specify at the start of the project and then forget about. Transformed digital services need to reflect and adapt to the broader internet context of their users on an ongoing basis. James Weiner writes about the decisions made about browser support for the Beta of GOV.UK (January 2012). Ben Welby discusses the operating systems, browsers and devices supported for the launch of GOV.UK (October 2012). Tom Byers explores the practical ways in which GOV.UK has been designed for different devices (November 2012). Dafydd Vaughan with an update on browser usage on GOV.UK post-launch.

It’s also a method service teams can use to sort and arrange user needs. The method is very simple to use: it involves simply writing the needs or topics on pieces of card (maximum of around 50) and asking representative users to organise these into groups, which are then given a meaningful label. 15 to 30 users are recommended: a minimum of 15 users will give reasonable confidence in the results, but any more than 30 gives diminishing returns. It is also possible to conduct a closed card sort, whereby the users are given pre-determined categories and are asked to allocate each card to one of these categories. Open card sorts are most suitable for identifying how users think about information, in order to build an information architecture. Closed card sorts are most suitable for validating an information architecture. The analysis of card sorting can be difficult if no clear categories emerge. It can also be difficult to conduct a card sort on a very large website with a broad scope of content (eg GOV.UK) since the maximum number of cards may not be representative of all of the content. Card sorts can also be conducted using an online tool such as OptimalSort.

Make sure that any decision to use existing software, whether open source or proprietary, doesn’t stop you from sharing new software created under a permissive, GPL-compatible open source licence.  This is for guidance purposes only, so don’t take it as legal advice. At different points in your project you’ll have to choose one technology over others, which could be a choice between: Assume that most of your technology choices can or will change, especially during the early stages of development, eg: On day 1 of your project you simply won’t know enough about the domain or the user need to select the right technology. It’s OK to make an educated guess at this stage, as long as everyone understands this. Be sure to find the time to challenge your selection as you learn more about the problem at hand. When making choices on what technology to use, it’s very easy to immediately jump to a specific product. This tends to be based either on past experience or on current trends. Carrying out this process will make sure that you: When choosing technology, make sure you consider the total cost as well as any upfront fees. Take into consideration costs for things like: Make sure that you understand the cost implications of any unusually high user loads in production systems. Involve the whole team in technology choices. That doesn’t mean no one is in charge of making decisions, but that you want the development team (including web ops people) to share their insight on: Expect technology preferences to vary, and for opinions to be divided when choosing technology. All things being equal, picking technologies that developers and operations staff like will typically result in improved productivity. You’ll make these processes a lot easier if you: Technology lock-in happens when your previous decisions limit future decisions, possibly leaving you with only 1 option. For example, if you select a database that runs on only 1 operating system, you have no choice about the operating system you’ll use. If the costs of that operating system jump, you have no simple way of reducing that cost quickly or cheaply. Being locked in to one vendor, or one way of doing things, can create difficulties like: Over time, and after many decisions, you can find yourself in a situation where all your technology decisions are tightly coupled and you are locked-in to one vendor, or one way of doing things. This can have unforeseen financial costs (for example an overnight cost increase). It might also limit how quickly you can iterate on your product in the future (if, for instance, the ideal technology choice isn’t compatible with your current vendor or technology). When you decide on a certain technology, be sure to have a clear understanding of the cost or implications of moving away from it, and avoid lock-in whenever possible. This could mean choosing not to use certain features (eg non-standard extensions to protocols, APIs or programming languages), so you have the ability to move to another technology as and when. In general, avoid making long-term commitments to any particular technology, product or supplier until you fully understand the problem you’re trying to solve. Even then, make sure you maximise your future development options and avoid technology lock-in if at all possible. If there’s an existing software solution that solves your problem, definitely think about using it. If you’re using software to satisfy a rare or niche need, you’re less likely to find a tool that will serve and continue to serve those needs. In these situations, expect that you’ll have to create new software. However, there are many situations where it makes more sense to use existing software like: In most cases, many projects will have the same need so it makes little sense to reinvent the wheel for certain types of software, eg: Share software that’s developed to meet the needs of government wherever possible under a permissive, GPL-compatible open source licence (eg MIT/X11 or 3-clause BSD) unless doing so would: Sharing software means it can be widely used and improved by anyone in the world who has a similar need. It’s important that other governments in particular have the opportunity to reuse the software you’ve created, because everyone deserves to have digital services so good that people prefer to use them. For example GovSpeak and unicorn herder are small components that were developed as a part of GOV.UK. They’re now used by several different organisations, and have received a number of public contributions. In practice, sharing usually means: Store the ‘master’ version of your software on an internal source code control system and replicate the latest version to a public repository. Sometimes it’s not possible to share software that was developed for the government by a third party because the third party retains ownership of the ‘intellectual property’ (IP) embodied in that software. So, when working with third parties, Avoid contracts that: On other occasions a team may take a risk-based decision not to share some of the software they‘ve created, eg to avoid exposing the details of a particular risk-assessment algorithm or process to the public. It’s good engineering practice in any case to encapsulate software, and so often in this situation a large portion of the software for a given system or service can still be shared in public. The default assumption should be in favour of coding in the open and sharing software widely. But if you have serious concerns about sharing source code in public, then CESG can provide you with advice based on your specific situation. See also the joint Cabinet Office / CESG statement on Open Source Software and Security. With the growth of free/open source software, many high quality technology products (databases, operating systems, programming languages, development tools, etc) are freely available for government and its suppliers to use and improve. Yet a large market still exists for commercial software products, and the availability of open source software doesn’t automatically mean that you can’t choose a proprietary technology if it meets your needs. Still, the policy of government is that open source will be selected on the basis of its inherent flexibility. This is norm when there is no significant overall difference to cost between open and non-open source products that fulfil minimum and essential capabilities. For more information on how to make sure there’s a level playing field between proprietary and open source software, see the: Make sure that any decision to use existing software, whether open source or proprietary, doesn’t stop you from sharing new software created under a permissive, GPL-compatible open source licence. A successful open source project will collect contributions from a large number of sources, both inside and outside of a single organisation. Allow developers time to review contributions, and answer issues and discussions raised by others using the software. Make sure developers have: Larger open source projects often develop an extension model that makes it possible for others to continue to use the service in a variety of often unexpected and possibly undesirable ways whilst keeping the core project coherent under the editorship of a small, trusted group of committers. Take every opportunity to contribute back to the open source projects you use, which can be in the form of: Cite the open source code you use, as in the GOV.UK colophon – you can read more about this approach on the GDS blog entry about coding in the open. Keys, passwords and other secrets must always be stored safely and securely away from source code following Kerckhoffs’s principle. This separation of project code from deployed instances of a project is good development practice regardless of whether or not the software itself is shared in public. It’s advisable for large, significant projects to have a private space to discuss security issues and develop a patch. This removes the risk of flagging a vulnerability before a fix has been deployed. This is especially advisable if there’s a small number of participating developers. Choosing technology is important, but it’s probably not quite as important as you think. What’s important are the users of that technology and being able to produce quality at a sustainable pace and suitable cost. When making technology choices, and importantly as you develop your product and constantly reassess your selections, try and make decisions that: Open standards considerations","description":"This is for guidance purposes only, so don’t take it as legal advice.","link":"/service-manual/making-software/choosing-technology.html"},{"_type":"manual_section","organisations":["government-digital-service"],"manual":"service-manual","title":"Government Service Design Manual: Cloud security","indexable_content":"Cloud first Cloud security principles Implementing the cloud security principles Not all principles are relevant to all services Further reading Data in transit protection Asset protection and resilience Separation between consumers Governance Operational security Personnel security Secure development Supply chain security Secure consumer management Identity and authentication External interface protection Secure service administration Audit information provision to consumers Secure use of the service by the consumer A description of the principle – what it is and why it is important A number of implementation objectives – how the principle should be satisfied A number of approaches that can be taken to meet the implementation objectives, attracting different residual risks ISO/IEC 27001 – information security management Cloud Security Alliance – cloud controls matrix Cloud security guidance home page    public sector organisations should consider and fully evaluate potential cloud solutions first – before they consider any other option     This approach is mandated to central government and strongly recommended to the wider public sector.

Establish the sensitivity of information held in accordance with the Security Classification Policy, establish legal responsibilities, develop user friendly, proportionate and justifiable security controls according to the Security Policy Framework. Separate commodity from niche needs and purchase accordingly. Use cost-effective commodity services for infrastructure and utility business activities like office productivity (word processing, spreadsheets and presentation software, email, scheduling and collaboration). Identify and acquire capabilities rather than infrastructure where services required are bespoke/innovative.

In order to do this you will need to identify the capabilities and services that make up your technology design, and demonstrate that the solution chosen represents best value for money. Purchase networking and telephony services through the Public Services Network frameworks and Data Centre capacity through Crown Hosting Service. Applications should be accessible through a browser to ensure your solution will work for any end user device. Ensure best environmental practices, whether in-house or via external suppliers, including compliance with Greening Government ICT. Any software licence agreements must evidence actual user needs – there should be no default continuation of enterprise licence deals or specification of products or brands. Share resources: services, information, data and software components must be shared in order to encourage reuse, avoid duplication and prevent redundant investments. Reuse includes the use of existing services and capabilities that already exist outside of government where they provide best value for money, eg identity verification, fraud and debt management, cloud-based commodity services. Align to the shared services strategy for HR, procurement, finance and payroll. Plan on using an agile process, starting with the user need. Waterfall should only be used by exception and where it can be shown to better meet user need. Projects may need the best of both formal and agile methods, playing to their respective strengths: producing successful IT services is about knowing when to use the right tool at the right time.

Automated testing is an important part of our overall approach to quality but only one part of it. There are various approaches to writing automated tests. In particular there are differences in when people expect to write tests, and in the ways that they’re expressed. Many practitioners insist that automated tests should always be written before the code they seek to test (to ensure careful design and ‘just enough’ code) while others are happier writing tests after the fact. Tests that are written before the code offer a number of advantages and that approach should be encouraged, but the most important thing is that the whole team works to ensure there are automated tests, that those tests are understood as an asset of the product and that they help you ensure the quality of your code. It is common to talk about behaviour-driven development (BDD) as an alternative approach to test-driven development. BDD is an approach to automated testing that focuses on expressing tests in the “ubiquitous language” that the whole team should share when discussing problems. There are various tools that have been created to facilitate BDD but it is an approach that can be implemented using most traditional tools. Any code written for your service should have a set of tests operating at 2 levels: This requires broad tests that run through high-level functionality end-to-end, making sure that the pieces of the system come together to provide the right service. A developer in your team should be able to describe the steps in any acceptance test to the product/service manager in a way that makes sense to them and matches how they expect the service to be used (or abused!) This concentrates on the specific details of the code, making sure that each separate unit of code does what is expected of it by: Write tests whenever a bug is discovered. Then write a test to reproduce the bug before it’s fixed, so you can confirm that the bug has been fixed and make sure that it isn’t reintroduced later. GDS aim to write a first set of tests at the start of working on a feature. Acceptance tests that describe the expected end-to-end behaviour of code make sure that: These tests are often described as ‘happy path’ or ‘sad path’: GDS start with happy path tests and a few simple sad path tests, and then add more sad path tests as understanding of the code and its dependencies develops. Developers are expected to run tests regularly, especially before sharing new code. Examine the code in tests as part of the code review process, and regularly run tests in a shared continuous integration system. This gives the whole team a chance to see how they’re performing.","description":"GDS use automated testing to:","link":"/service-manual/making-software/code-testing.html"},{"_type":"manual_section","organisations":["government-digital-service"],"manual":"service-manual","title":"Government Service Design Manual: Community user groups","indexable_content":"How research communities work Where and how you might use it When not to use Participants rapid speed (questions are answered in real time, research team can react rapidly to internal demands) cost effective when up and running flexibility availability rich outputs (visual content such as video is regularly used and is impactful) deep insights raises profile of research internally when insight is relevant and timely An online research community is a website that allows pre-selected respondents to interact with each other and complete a series of tasks. The types of community differ, and vary in openness, permanency and size. A typical community will be private, often have between 300-500 members and focus on building relationships between participants. This type of community offers a great source of deep insight over long periods of time. The tasks given to a research community differ in format and can include; online forums, blogs, polls, surveys, instant chat and more. Tasks are usually creative, and ask different questions relating to the research objective/s. Research communities can be used for a wide range of projects such as audience understanding, diary studies, concept development or simply idea generation. They allow a business to get close to users and offer meaningful dialogue between an organisation and its customers. The key benefits are: Communities require constant management. Participants need to be kept engaged, which means daily interaction, new questions and inventive approaches to maintain their interest. The community needs constant moderation, usually by a research manager or third party research agency. The quality of community members is paramount. Their feedback needs to be quality checked and panel attrition needs to be monitored on an on-going basis to ensure fresh ideas. Participants can be obtained using public postings on websites, email groups and social media, or via third party sample companies.","description":"An online research community is a website that allows pre-selected respondents to interact with each other and complete a series of tasks.","link":"/service-manual/user-centred-design/user-research/community-user-groups.html"},{"_type":"manual_section","organisations":["government-digital-service"],"manual":"service-manual","title":"Government Service Design Manual: Completion rate","indexable_content":"What you will be measuring How to measure completion rate When to measure completion rate Before the transaction starts Start and end points Dropouts Saving or resuming progress during a transaction Multiple endpoints Offline fulfilment Completion rate measurement frequency Testing the completion rate before launch Post-launch measurement Work out the number of completed transactions.

This leads to low levels of digital take-up and customer satisfaction, and a higher cost per transaction. Measuring end-to-end completion rates helps to identify whether users have problems completing a transaction. Analysing the drop-out rate at each step of a transaction will pinpoint the specific processes that users fail to complete. The completion rate measures the proportion of people who start a transaction and are able to complete it. A transaction is a self-contained process that’s defined by the service manager, and is typically only completed when a user has been through the whole thing end to end. A transaction completed only partially online means the user may complete a single process within the overall transaction, like booking an appointment or completing a part of an application. Before the transaction has started, users should clearly be told: Also provide users with the eligibility criteria and the costs to complete the transaction. This will help you to reduce dropouts later on in the transaction. Typically the eligibility criteria will be given on a single page. In some cases, there may be a set of pages that checks a user’s eligibility based on information they provide. Don’t make it possible for users to bypass your service’s start page via links or search engine results. Users who try to directly access another page in the transaction should be sent back to your start page, unless they are resuming a previously saved transaction. Transactions will begin and end on GOV.UK to allow GDS to monitor completion rates.  A transaction is considered to have been started and completed only when the user: Data on the number of started and completed transactions will be shared with service owners.  Service managers will be responsible for measuring and monitoring dropout rates within transactions which aren’t hosted on GOV.UK. You should analyse this data and use it to improve your service. Build your service with unique URLs for each step or page. This will make your service much easier to measure. Some services allow users to save a transaction mid flow and to resume it another time. For the purpose of completion rate, make it possible to match your saved transactions with resumed transactions so they can be treated as one continuous process. Consider applying a nominal time limit to saved transactions after which, if they haven’t been resumed, they are classed as failed. Alternatively, saved transactions could be set to expire after a given length of time.                           Some services have complex journeys and there may be several points where a transaction can be successfully completed. Service managers define these areas, and make sure they point to appropriate end pages on GOV.UK so they count towards the completed transaction total. Some transactional services have both digital and non-digital areas. For example, when granting a lasting power of attorney, users can start and finish the transaction online, but are required to print, sign and post a form in the middle of the process. In these situations treat the second online part of the transaction as a user continuing on from the first part. Where it’s not possible to match the two, treat the single digital parts of the service as separate tasks, with the completion rate measured for each. Offline parts of the process can still be measured, but this is likely to be done through qualitative feedback (eg from surveys, diary studies, focus groups). To successfully measure your service completion rate, GDS recommend that: Completion rate should be measured continuously. Once the service is live this will be done on GOV.UK. Before launch, measure completion rates with usability testing. This should be iteratively tested with at least 5 people. This should identify over 85% of usability problems. Users will be given a pre-determined set of tasks that reflect what needs to be done to use the service. These tasks will include all aspects of using the service that apply, like: If users are having difficulty completing tasks, carry out more user testing after each new development. Digital analytics will be the primary method for measuring task completion rates post launch. Please note that this relies on extra configuration in the analytics tool. It will not be available by default. The aim of your service team’s activities will be to continually improve completion rates by monitoring where users are dropping out of the transaction process, and testing out new designs for those pages. End-to-end completion rates will be piped automatically from GOV.UK’s digital analytics into the Performance Platform and will be publicly available from the point of launch. Further usability testing should also be carried out once a service has gone live to measure use of the service and identify any issues and improvements that can be made.

It’s important to get it right as your system is likely to be much larger than a single application, relying on other supporting infrastructure components. Even a simple application probably requires some configuration, like providing database credentials or a web service endpoint. Managing your configuration data well will mean you can build a stable, scalable and portable system. Configuration management tools will help with documenting and maintaining the configuration and dependencies of your software system. Although you can do this using hand-made software, it’s common to use existing tools. Three examples of existing open source configuration management tools are: One approach to managing configuration is to describe in code the configuration and software dependencies (what your software needs to perform its function). This brings with it all the advantages of programming in general, including: Once written in code, the infrastructure configuration is then run against the servers, networks and software in question. Moving software systems between providers can be difficult and time-consuming. Even with compatible providers and simpler procurement rules, it’s possible to lock yourself in through inaction alone. Configuration management encourages a deep understanding of the configuration of your system. Use this understand to move software easily between providers, if needed. A common problem in software systems is when code written by a development team works on their machine or a test environment, but not on the production environment. A common cause of this is differences in configuration: Avoid this by using the same tools for your development and production environments. Existing methods to managing configuration are often manual, process-heavy, slow and error prone. Ultimately, people are bad at carrying out detailed monotonous tasks - and installing and configuring software across tens or hundreds of servers (if done by hand) is definitely monotonous. Even if this could be done to provide everything correctly configured on day 0, configuration will drift if not kept in check. A traditional solution to this problem is to make it harder to change configuration, which then limits the number of changes that can made. Overall, the ability to change rapidly is essential when trying to build agile and flexible software systems, which means breaking down those restrictive manual processes.","description":"Configuration management is about managing how the pieces of your software and/or service work together.","link":"/service-manual/making-software/configuration-management.html"},{"_type":"manual_section","organisations":["government-digital-service"],"manual":"service-manual","title":"Government Service Design Manual: Confirmation pages","indexable_content":"that they have successfully completed the transaction their reference number if there is one what further actions they need to perform, and when what further actions they can expect from the service, and when who they should contact with any queries or complaints about any related information and services The confirmation page should be the last page of the transaction.

Producing regular iterations makes it easier for you to: If your software isn’t ready to be used then it’s not creating any real value. Treat it as stock piling up – and stock is waste. The Lean software development philosophy tells us to: Test all iterations of your software, either through public user testing or automated testing (using separate software to perform the testing). Automate your deployment process so you are forced to fully understand it. Then any issues with moving code from your version control system into production (when it’s gone live) can be dealt with early on. Automating it early also means that code will be tested and any bugs fixed so that releases become frequent, low-risk, almost boring events. Don’t plan production release slots far in advance. You can’t be certain what will be ready in 6 months’ time. Make your release planning simpler – make sure it’s flexible enough that any feature or update to your software can be deployed when it’s ready. Then, if a feature needs to miss a release slot, it can easily be rescheduled for tomorrow or next week, rather than in 6 months, or more if the next slot is already full. Another advantage is being able to quickly respond to security patches or similar changes in underlying  libraries or frameworks used by your application. You can quickly make a change and watch the update flow through the various gates in your deployment pipeline, confident that nothing has been broken. What happens to code between it being written by a developer and deployed to production is known as the deployment pipeline. Understand your end-to-end deployment pipeline. Knowing how it works and how each element works together will have implications for: The deployment pipeline has 4 stages: When your developer checks into version control (where all code, including previous versions, are stored), a range of tests should be run against the latest version of the code. Any quick, easy-to-identify defects, like compile errors or unit test failures will be found at this stage. If the tests pass, the code progresses to the next stage and should be considered for release into production. Send the code to a shared sandbox (testing) environment. This is the first environment where the application is deployed and run. It’s also the first stage where it can be visually inspected for quality by anybody on the team. Make the sandbox environment as similar to the production (live) version as far as is practical. For example, if production uses Postgres, the sandbox should also use Postgres and not another database like MySQL or SQLite. The purpose is to find any defects in the code. If a defect is found, stop the version of the code at this stage. If it passes the sandbox environment it can move on to further specialist testing environments. You may need to perform additional testing for specialist requirements, like load and performance testing, penetration testing, or accessibility testing. The amount of environments you’ll need will depend on the requirements and conditions of your individual projects. When you are satisfied with the quality of the code, move it to the live production environment. Your code is ready to go live if it has passed: Deploy to production the same way as you deploy to any other environment – use the same scripts, same configuration management tooling, and the same version of the code.  This means you’re not releasing code for the first time – you’re performing a task that’s been validated at each stage throughout the deployment pipeline.","description":"Continuous delivery is about producing regular iterations of your software that’s ready to be released (deployed), though you don’t have to release these iterations to the public.","link":"/service-manual/agile/continuous-delivery.html"},{"_type":"manual_section","organisations":["government-digital-service"],"manual":"service-manual","title":"Government Service Design Manual: Cookies","indexable_content":"Cookies explained Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations Using cookies Types of cookies Cookie information and warnings Cookie scoping and attributes Further reading First party cookies Third party cookies Exempt cookies what to keep in mind when including cookies into your services how and why you must notify users about cookies on your service get explicit, informed consent from the user before storing cookies on a user’s computer be satisfied that the user understands that their actions will result in cookies being stored (implied consent) be satisfied that the cookie is “absolutely essential” to the operation of the website (eg cookies used for operating a shopping cart) first party cookies third party cookies exempt cookies cookies for storing logged in status cookies for storing user preferences some types of analytics cookies what data is stored within them how long the data is stored for what the data is used for under the control of the third party service, not the website operator can be accessed on any website that makes use of the service can be used to track a user from one site to another cookies from social media sharing services cookies from advertising campaign management services cookies from embedded document sharing services (eg dropbox) cookies from some analytics services being used for load balancing being absolutely essential to website functionality (eg used to store shopping cart contents)    “GOV.UK uses cookies to make the site simpler.

As services become more efficient, the cost per transaction will fall. Cost per transaction is about how much it costs government to provide each completed transaction. You should measure the difference in the cost of the transaction through each available channel. Understanding these costs will help you to accurately forecast savings and build a strong business case for making services digital by default. The total cost includes all fixed and variable costs of the transaction through a given channel, including overheads. It does not include start up costs. Where resources (eg call centres) are shared with other services, costs should be split appropriately. For example, if half of all calls received relate to a specific service, then assign 50% of the call centre costs to that service. Where processes and costs are common to more than one channel (eg processing wet signatures for passports, or printing driving licences), split costs appropriately. For example, if half of all transactions are completed digitally, then assign 50% of the common costs to the digital channel.

Similarly, use labels like ‘Create a username’ and ‘Create a password’ rather than ‘Username’ and ‘Password’, so people understand that they’re not being asked enter existing ones.  Creating an account is rarely a user goal. People come to your service to use it not to create an account – your calls to action should reflect this. Make the choice between creating an account and signing in explicit. Presenting the options side by side is not enough – people will miss one of them or not understand the difference. If you can, ask people if they’ve used the service before and then direct them to either sign in or create an account. If users fail to create an account they might not be able to use your service at all. Account creation screens should be about this one task, so strip out any distracting content or links.

Well structured Microsoft Word documents make good source documents for conversion to PDF. When a source document is converted into PDF it is tagged. The PDF tag tree reflects the structure of the document, and it’s this structure that assistive technologies like screen readers use to navigate the document. Use the styles and features available in Word to format your content and give it structure. This will make it easier to convert your source document into PDF because it lays the groundwork for the PDF tag tree. Use the heading styles in Word to create a logical document structure. Don’t increase the size of text or make it bold to create the appearance of headings. Treat your document like a book: It should have one title (level one heading) and multiple chapters (level two headings). Within each chapter there may be multiple sections (level three headings) and sub sections (level four headings). Use the list styles in Word to group together related items. If the items follow a specific sequence, use a numbered list instead. Don’t use punctuation or other markers to create the illusion of a list. If your document is longer than a few pages, use Word to automatically create a table of contents based on your heading structure. Don’t use lists and links to manually create a table of contents. Use left aligned text (unless the language of your document is read right to left). Don’t use justified text in your document. Choose a sans serif font and use the styles in Word to set it as the default, with a minimum size of 12pt. If you need to include footnotes or other text of a smaller size, increase the size of the body text to 14pt rather than reducing the size of any text below 12pt. Don’t use chunks of italicised or capitalised text, and don’t underline text unless it’s a link. Use foreground/background colours for text that have a good contrast ratio. The 4.5:1 ratio recommended by the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 is a good minimum. Don’t use colour or shape as the only way to identify something in your document. Use text labels or descriptions instead. Use tables with column headings to display data. Don’t use tables to make cosmetic changes to the layout of the document. Use Word to add text descriptions to all important images in the document. Make sure the text description includes all the information contained within, or conveyed by, the image. Use Adobe Acrobat Pro to convert your Word document into PDF. Use the Convert to PDF option under the Adobe menu in Microsoft Word to do this. This will ensure that Acrobat picks up the accessibility you have built into your source document. Set the language of the document. Go to File > Properties > Advanced and select a language from the Language menu. If the PDF is written in Welsh, type CY into the box. All content must be tagged, marked as an artefact (background content), or removed from the tag tree. Use the Tags panel to review and edit the tag tree. If the PDF was converted from a well structured Word document, the tag tree should require little editing. If the PDF contains form fields, use Advanced > Accessibility > Touch up reading order to check they can be navigated with the tab key in a logical order. If the tab order needs improving, use the Order panel to drag and drop the fields into the correct order. Use the Tags panel to review and edit the reading order of the PDF. Don’t rely on the visual order of the PDF. The reading order is based on the structure of the PDF tag tree, which may not match the visual content order. Use View > Zoom > Reflow then check that the PDF still has a logical reading order. Note: It can sometimes be difficult to guarantee a logical reflow order for PDFs with complex content. Go to Advanced > Accessibility > Touch up reading order and check that all images have text descriptions. If the text descriptions were present in the source Word document and the Convert to PDF option was used, the text descriptions should already be present in the PDF. Remove empty tags from the tag tree. Use the Tags panel to highlight and delete any empty tags from the tag tree. Tag decorative content elements as artefacts. Use Advanced > Accessibility > Touch up reading order to select a decorative element, and use the Background button to make the element an artefact. Use the Tags panel to check the structure of data tables. The <table>, <tr> and <td> tags should be used to give data tables the proper structure. Use the Tags panel to check that links are active. Active links should be tagged with the <link> tag. Use File > Preference > Accessibility to set a high contrast colour scheme, and check the PDF remains readable. It may not be possible to make high contrast mode work in all PDFs, in which case you should be prepared to make a high contrast version available on request. Display the document title instead of the file name. Go to File > Properties > Initial view and select Document title from the Show drop down box. Once all the above steps have been taken, the PDF should be checked before it is published. Go to Advanced > Accessibility and select Full check. The PDF should pass the full check for WCAG 2.0 Level AA without any warnings. Ask a screen reader user to read through the PDF. If no-one is available to do this, use one of the following options instead. Non Visual Desktop Access (NVDA) is a free open source screen reader for Windows. It can be installed to the desktop or run from a portable USB thumb drive. With NVDA running, open the PDF and use the following commands to check the PDF: These commands will also work with the JAWS screen reader from Freedom Scientific. VoiceOver is the integrated screen reader with Mac OS X and all iOS devices. In Mac OS X turn VoiceOver on (or off again) using Command + F5. With VoiceOver running open the PDF and use the following commands to check the PDF: VoiceOver does not provide shortcut keys for navigating PDFs by headings or graphics.

Improving the way that you produce digital services is more about cultural and behavioural change than it is about IT. Technology alone will not be able to improve public services. Your digital services are based on user needs, not on organisation structures and processes. You have: To create better public services you’ll need to change existing behaviours and cultures, and successfully transition to new ways of working. You may need to develop skills within your team and keep up to date on new methods and technologies. It may also be necessary to change your physical working environment to get the best out of your team. You may need to radically change governance and management structures and will need to run projects in a more agile way. You’ll need an effective approach to information management, ensuring you adhere to the high level direction and guidance provided in the Information Principles. You’ll need to build relationships with new suppliers that you may have found through new procurement routes, such as the G-Cloud framework. It may be necessary and more cost-effective to write-off previous financial investments, so you’ll need courage and conviction to stop spending on old, legacy systems. The Cabinet Office, through spending controls, has a strong preference against extending contracts to support legacy systems. At the very least you’ll need an exit management strategy that sets out a plan for how you will significantly reduce any dependence on outdated technology. The cost of maintaining out-of-date technology that isn’t fit for purpose could far outweigh the cost of changing to a more suitable technology that better meets user needs. If you’re in this position, it’s also likely that the architecture and hosting of your existing estate may need to be rethought. You may come across inertia or resistance when you try to make necessary changes to your technology or how your service is provided. Your existing supplier base will tend to resist change – and the more successful a supplier has been working under the old model, and the more entrenched it is, the greater this resistance is likely to be. The changes needed will often be more successfully initiated and produced by those not encumbered by past success – new market entrants and those traditionally closed out from government work, like small or medium-sized businesses. You may find that you have become locked-in to a particular contract or technology. As part of your consideration of the total cost of ownership of a particular solution, you should have estimated the cost of exit at the start of implementation. If you try to move and find that cost is a barrier, any unlocking costs that you have identified must be associated with the incumbent supplier/system and not be considered as part of the cost of a new solution. Building on open standards or selecting products which use them will help you to avoid this problem in the future. If you have incumbent suppliers, it’s important that you understand and anticipate their likely reaction as they struggle to maintain the status quo and resist change. Incumbent suppliers will have data that reflects the past success of their business models and the way their business worked. They will be less certain about the future and may be concerned about the weakening of their market share and their exposure to genuine, open competition. The rewards and culture of these companies are likely to be built on their current business model. That will reinforce their internal resistance to change. It’s difficult for them to persuade shareholders and financial investors to replace a well-understood, if obsolete, business model with an approach that favours the treatment of some IT products as commodities. The IT as utility market is not yet fully established, so they will be uncertain about it even though this model might bring them higher profits on lower revenues. You’ll also see similar resistance in-house, where many staff may have long grown accustomed to old ways of working. It’s important that as a leader you provide the assistance and mentoring they need to help update their skills and experience. Some may have become dependent on external suppliers’ advice. Some may even have built their career on accreditation in a single supplier’s technologies. Flexible technology and services give service managers the ability evolve services and make them responsive to users’ needs. It also avoids costly and more risky big bang changes. Reducing the risk of lock-in to suppliers, software, service and support, or too old and inefficient IT, means that you have the ability to choose what best meets the outcomes you are looking for at a sustainable and competitive cost and at a timescale that suits you. GOV.UK is an example of how this works in practice. On the technology side, we set up hosting to build the beta of GOV.UK and then transferred it to a new supplier on the G-Cloud framework before launch. In early 2014, the infrastructure team at GDS migrated GOV.UK to a new hosting environment. Sam Sharpe wrote a blog post on the technical aspects of the migration and Carl Massa explained the project in a video. G-Cloud is the procurement framework intended for purchasing Infrastructure as a Service, Platform as a Service and Software as a Service products.

To do that, we need to have a consistent visual grammar, for use both within GDS and across government. This guide sets out 4 principles of good data presentation, with easy to follow checklists to help you achieve this. For context, we’ve added examples of how the principles have been employed at GDS. The principles and examples found in this guide are likely to evolve as we find new challenges and applications for them. There are many examples of best practice style guides already in place. For example, The Economist has a clearly defined house style that allows its readers to readily identify and understand their visualisations. They publish a new visualisation every day in their Graphic Detail. This guide attempts to build on the best practice from a range of organisations. The GOV.UK Performance Platform helps the government make decisions based on data, often presented through innovative visualisations (built using D3.js). The example below compares weekly visitors to GOV.UK with the two main websites it replaced.  To effectively tell the story behind the numbers, you need to understand both your audience and the data. Only use visualisations if they make the story clearer. In many cases, a good table or words may communicate better than a visualisation. If there are very few data points (eg top rate income tax down 5%, all other rates unchanged), it’s clearer to write a sentence than draw a picture. If every item must be read precisely (to several decimal places) then a table is best. A good table will be clear and uncluttered. The data should be easy to read with the same decimal places or rounded and sorted into a logical order. Don’t use too many different types of font, and make sure your data is referenced. But visualisations often are the right answer and the data is the most important feature. It should tell its own story and it’s best to not try to say too much in one go. Keep charts simple, cutting down on unnecessary items and jargon.  Explanatory text will be needed in some cases, but it should not simply repeat the story being told in the visualisation. A well written chart title can reinforce the story of the data and reduce the amount of additional text needed. Choosing the right visualisation will help the data tell its own story and give powerful insight. There are many ways of displaying information visually.  Most computer programmes come with a range of visualisations. There also visualisation tools available online: for example, this blog showcases some free ones and GDS has produced a guide to infographics Each chart has its own strength. Below are the core 5 with templates (a Google spreadsheet of these is available):  Strengths - comparing items, or a small number of time periods.  Strengths - comparing items, especially if they have long names or many items.  Strengths - comparing over time or between variables for a single item (eg site traffic vs site performance)  Strengths - simple share of total. Use with caution as column or bar charts are often better. Limit to 2 segments to avoid confusion.  Strengths - relationships between variables where there are many items (eg volume vs cost for numerous transactions) There is more help on choosing the right chart here. It is important to not confuse your audience. Choosing the correct visualisation is important and at GDS we reviewed what was being used in the performance dashboard. As the example below shows, Pie charts with many items are not clear. We used a stacked bar chart to better represent the data.   Keep in mind these useful tips when creating your charts: Keeping your visualisation simple will help the data tell its own story. Chartjunk is anything in your visualisation using ink that actively reduces clarity. Avoid: Know your audience so you give the right amount of supporting information. External or non-technical audiences will need more explanation but internal or expert audiences may find this tedious. Don’t use the text to simply repeat what’s being said by the data. Visualisations should avoid too much data. Only include what’s relevant. If the trend is obvious, don’t include a trendline. Sometimes it may be more effective to focus on high-value items only (if you’re being selective, be open and clear about this). Poor colour choice can change how the data is perceived in a visualisation. For example, red is strongly associated with negative performance so is best avoided for positive/normal figures. Colour blindness makes it difficult for a user to differentiate between data sets. Labelling charts directly and different line styles can help. If your visualisations are likely to be printed it’s important the colours work in greyscale as not all users will have high quality printers. The example below from the GDS senior management dashboard shows how avoiding chart junk and limiting the number of datasets can enhance your visualisation.  The legend accounts for a quarter of display space. The Y axis quotes £ and not £m. The segments are profiles and proportionate for each time period, so the bright colouring adds no extra detail. The mix of bar and line is confusing with so much information in the chart.  The stacked column gave a level of detail which wasn’t needed. This has been rationalised to best suit the audience. Axes have been standardised. The legend has been relocated giving the chart more space. Heavy grid lines and axes have been removed to give a clearer display. “We want transparency to become an absolutely core part of every bit of government business.” - Francis Maude Being open and transparent supports the Open Data White Paper. Similarly, our Open Public Services agenda is built on transparency. Sourcing data builds trust and credibility. Providing contact information shows ownership but also helps collaboration and information sharing. When presenting data be aware of axes and scales. Data can be misrepresented by only showing a selection if it isn’t clear why an extract has been chosen. Consider where the visualisation might be published. For example, if published alongside other visualisations, the reader is likely to assume the scales are consistent. This might change how your data is perceived.

Choose a format appropriate for the kind of date you’re asking about. For capturing memorable dates like dates of birth, the simplest option is to provide text fields for users to type the date in. For example: Calendar controls are not particularly useful for known dates and some users struggle with select boxes. We’re currently recommending using three fields as it’s easier to reliably validate than a single field. Tip: If you want to trigger the num-pad on iPhones, add a pattern attribute to the input element like this: pattern=\"[0-9]*\" If you require a date to be provided EXACTLY as it’s given on another document (a passport or credit card for example), then it’s easier for users to copy the date across if the format is the same. If you don’t need an exact date and users are likely to struggle to remember it (for example the date you started your first job), make sure you allow users to enter approximate dates like ‘June 1996’. Some dates make most sense relative to today’s date or another date. This is particularly common when booking appointments of some kind. In these cases it helps if you let users enter or select relative dates like ‘tomorrow’ or ‘4 days later’. If the day of the week is important, show this as well.  Calendar controls are only appropriate for near past or future dates, where the day of the week is relevant. Their main use case is for appointment booking. If you also need to show information like availability, embed the calendar in the page and make it large enough for the information to be readable.

This approach brings with it many advantages and some challenges. The amount of software available to reuse in your project is huge. This may be open source libraries or frameworks, or it may be commercial software appliances or applications, or it may be code already written by your organisation. Ultimately very very few software development projects will write absolutely everything from scratch. Where possible and sensible, aiming to reuse existing code makes sense and will reduce the time taken to develop the software you are tasked with building. Areas that are general, and not specific to your domain, are good examples of where a third party library is likely to exist. For instance for managing: There are a number of different strategies for reusing code, some of which are described below. In many cases a single project may use more than one of these, but in all cases it is worth doing so consciously. One approach to managing dependencies is simply to copy the code into your project. If you do take this approach be aware that not all open source licenses allow for this, while others will force you to license your code in the same way as the dependency. In general this approach is likely to be the last resort. Vendoring (as it is called) breaks the link with the third party code, meaning that tracking upstream changes becomes a manual (and likely slow, inconsistent and time consuming) job. Vendored code tends to become out of date quickly, ideally this should be avoided for more structured approaches. A common approach, especially amongst the open source community, is to pull in third party dependencies automatically using a dependency management tool – either at runtime, deploy time or compile time. The assurance that this third party code is working is provided by extensive testing, generally of an automated nature. This should include testing of security characteristics. For example if a library used to generate a web form introduces a SQL injection vulnerability, then your acceptance tests should fail. It is important under this model that a suitable level of verification is done, rather than just trusting any third party dependency completely. It’s also important to have trust in the specific code and version you are using, rather than just the library or framework in general. What is suitable will vary between services depending on the risk profile. Sometimes simply trusting a third party code repository does not provide the level of assurance required. In these cases, one approach is to fork, or copy, the third party code into a separate repository managed by you. This decouples updates to the upstream code from updates to your organisations copy of that code, but importantly maintains the link with the original. Your fork of the code can be updated periodically or based on required new functionality. The process for updating your fork may involve code reviews, virus scanning, checks against known vulnerabilities, etc. It would also be possible to modify the code at this point for your own internal use. The downside of this approach compared with the trust but verify approach above is the time taken to maintain the fork and to pull in changes from upstream. Not keeping up to date with upstream at all increases these costs and has the same issues as vendoring described above. It is worth noting that different programming language communities tend to view dependencies differently. It is very common for instance within the Ruby or JavaScript communities to find tiny libraries that do one trivial thing well. This tends to lead to projects with hundreds of dependencies very quickly. For instance the popular Ruby on Rails framework has 31 external dependencies at the time of writing. Within other communities it is less common to have so many independent dependencies, but it is worth noting that this tends to mean either a more comprehensive standard library (eg Python) or larger dependencies (eg Java). Ultimately the problem of dependency management exists within all programming communities, but the differences in tooling and approach are worth noting. Most programming languages will have a small number of popular dependency management tools. The following list has a number of examples from a variety of languages. By including third party dependencies in your application you are potentially including code with known or unknown vulnerabilities. Accepting this risk is important in order to mitigate it. In some cases code reviews of third party code may be required, in others good testing practices can be enough. Commercial tools do exist for some languages which aim to alert you to vulnerabilities in third party dependencies and can help with building trust in code. These are often based on publicly available vulnerability disclosure lists so it is also possible to track those individually. Most operating systems, vendors and some open source projects  will also have mailing lists to advise about security vulnerabilities in third party code. You should always be monitoring these lists where they exist for software you use. Some common examples include: The above is a small example of what is available. Having these emails come into an internal mailing list is also advisable, rather than rely on a single individual to alert everyone else.","description":"Most software projects, especially those using open source technologies, will\nuse third party code.

We’ve identified some common principles for software deployment which we’ve applied in a number of different projects, with different technology stacks and needs. These principles underpin a software deployment process which meets user needs. Those principles are: Deploying software should be a low-risk activity. By deploying software frequently and in small increments, the risk is reduced in a number of ways. See Regular Releases Reduce Risk from the GDS blog for more on this. Deploying software frequently makes life better for the product managers in your organisation. Frequent deployments allow the product managers to get things right in a timely fashion: both fixing bugs and releasing new features.  Roo Reynolds, GOV.UK mainstream product manager, said that “Deploying once a week would be frighteningly slow.”  The GOV.UK site design has changed radically 4 times since its public release in October 2012. This was enabled in part by frequent releases enabling rapid gathering of feedback and responding to change. The software that you deploy to production should be of a consistently high quality. The user impact of bugs is obvious; less obvious is that the earlier you identify bugs, the easier and cheaper they are to fix. The deployment itself should not be a risky process. By the time a version of the software is deployed to production, you should have confidence that it will work smoothly and seamlessly. How long does it take from a developer making a code change to that change hitting production? The shorter this time is, the faster a product can respond to change. The quicker you can release the next iteration, the faster you will converge on an ideal solution. You should know at any moment what version of your service is running in each environment. When a deployment hits production, you should be able to trace the changes that it introduced all the way back to the initial code commits in the source code repositories which went into that deploy. Combined with small, frequent releases, if any problem does hit production, you will be able to immediately narrow down the cause to a small number of commits.  Rolling back to a previous version is less onerous as less of the system has changed. And “rolling forward” – with a code change to fix the production issue – is achievable because the deployment process is automated and the lead time is short. An additional benefit of having a repeatable deployment process is that scaling and recovering from failure become easy. Suppose you want to add more application servers to host a particular application, either to respond to higher demand, or to replace failed instances.  Once you have provisioned the required machines, you can just re-run your deployment process on the new machines to deploy the software. Without a repeatable deployment process, adding machines becomes manual and error-prone. Many deployment processes incur a downtime cost. The more frequently you deploy, the more downtime you will experience as a result of deployment. This may be acceptable depending on the needs of your particular project,  or you may need to consider how your deployment process needs to change to achieve zero downtime. This isn’t a one-dimensional problem. Achieving zero downtime for read operations is easier than doing so for write operations. Whether or not your project has a business need for zero downtime deployments, it’s worth considering the tools and processes which make it possible, as the constraints of zero downtime deployments can result in better engineering practices generally. An antipattern in deployment processes is building a different application artefact for each environment. Examples of this might include controlling the presence of debugging symbols in the binary or variations in the use of optimisation flags. The problem is that the testing you do of code artefacts in preview environments may not be applicable to the artefact you deploy to production. The better alternative is to build a single artefact which gets deployed to all environments. With the same code running in each environment, you can deploy to production safe in the knowledge that this code has been tested in every other environment and has not been found wanting. Note that the exact nature of an artefact is intentionally vague. It may be You should have multiple environments to deploy to. At the very least, you will have a development environment running the latest version of the software, and a production environment being used by live users. You may also have other environments dedicated to exploratory testing, user testing, performance testing or a staging environment prior to production. The environments should be ordered so that a version of the software cannot be deployed to a later environment before it’s been deployed and tested in an earlier stage. That way, the software cannot be deployed to production without having been tested in every previous environment first. This does not need to be a strict linear ordering. Some sets of tests may be run in parallel – such as user acceptance testing and performance testing. However there is very often one single production environment which is later than all others, and one single entry point which precedes all others. One of the principles of good deployment is repeatable deployments. This does not just apply to application code. Applications don’t run in a vacuum, and often have particular requirements of the underlying system in which they run. The configuration of that system should be automated and repeatable. There are two main issues: ensuring that new builds of machines are repeatable, and ensuring that once built, machines do not suffer from configuration drift, in which small manual configuration changes are made over time, resulting in a system which is not in a reproducible state. Scripting the configuration of a new machine is not a difficult process. It will always start from a known state and can have a number of tasks to install packages, put configuration files in place and start services until the machine is in a good state. Managing configuration drift is more tricky, as to counteract manual changes to configuration, your system must be robust enough to take a machine from an unknown state to a known state. There are a number of tools for managing your infrastructure configuration, such as CFEngine, Chef, and Puppet. Each of these is designed such that they can be run repeatedly on a machine to alleviate configuration drift. If you’re using one of these tools, you need to provide a means to deploy new versions of the infrastructure code. There are two means of distributing infrastructure code: Using a server (Chef Server, Puppetmaster) In this kind of system,   you’ll have a central server that distributes configuration code   to each machine in your environment. Deploying new versions of code   requires only deploying to the server, that will then distribute it   to the clients. Serverless (Chef Solo, Masterless Puppet) Here, you’ll need to   distribute the configuration code to each individual node and ensure   that each node runs the code. An alternative strategy to avoid configuration drift is to use the immutable server pattern, in which once a machine is configured it’s never touched again. In order to deploy a new version of the software, an entirely new machine is provisioned and the old one discarded. Configuration drift is avoided because servers have short lifespans and are frequently replaced by new instances. This is a natural fit in virtualised environments and where the application artefact is a virtual machine template with the app pre-deployed, but can also be achieved using containerisation technology such as lxc. There are a number of options for deploying your code: You should think about how you’ll discover hosts that you deploy to. In a simple scenario, your deployment script may have a hard-coded list of application servers that it deploys to.  In this situation, there’s a risk that the hard-coded list of servers drifts to differ from the number of servers which actually exist in reality. This risk grows more likely with larger and more dynamic infrastructures.  There are more involved host discovery mechanisms, such as internal DNS, Zookeeper, or using a message-queue based system such as MCollective. Since you should be deploying the same artefact to each environment, both for infrastructure configuration management code and for application code, you’ll inevitably find a need to inject configuration which varies between environments, such as URLs of dependent services. For application configuration, your deployment mechanism should provide a way of injecting environment-specific configuration files into each environment. For infrastructure configuration, your infrastructure tool should provide some means of achieving this. For example, Puppet 3 provides Hiera, a hierarchical datastore for managing these values. Extra care must be taken when managing secrets such as database passwords or SSL keys. You want to ensure: For example, in a three-tier app with database, application and web servers, the database server does not need to know the  SSL (secure sockets layer) private keys for the site, nor does the web server need to know the database credentials. If you are using hiera, then hiera-gpg provides a solution to this problem. It allows the injection of values from GPG-encrypted files. Only those with an appropriate private key can access the contents. By creating a GPG key for each host in an environment, you can decide on a host-by-host basis which host can access which sets of secrets. If you are using chef, then chef data bags provide a similar solution. In projects which have high availability requirements, the process of deploying small code changes to production frequently may incur an unacceptable loss of service, if each deployment results in a short period of downtime. Therefore, it’s important to consider what engineering is necessary to enable deployments which do not result in any downtime at all. This is all subject to what your definition of downtime is. Maintaining uptime for read-based operations is relatively simple: a caching layer which can serve from stale can hide the absence of application servers; a database is easy to migrate from one master to another if it is placed into read-only mode first. Maintaining uptime for write-based operations is trickier, and requires up-front thought and design. If you know that you’ll have high uptime requirements for write-based or transactional operations, you’ll need to consider how that will affect your architecture and infrastructure. As applications evolve over time, so do the requirements that they place on their databases. Database migration scripts are short pieces of database code which transform the database in some way for the benefit of the application. To achieve zero downtime deployments, you should decouple application deployments from database migrations. If you’re performing zero downtime deployments, you’ll necessarily end up with multiple different versions of the application running concurrently. Conversely, the application will need to be tolerant to the eventuality of a database migration script running concurrently within the application lifetime. Note that database migrations should be subject to the same rigorous deployment pipeline as application code. They should be deployed to testing environments first, and only go to production once they have been applied and verified against all other environments. Services which depend on one another via an application programming interface (API) can experience similar deployment problems as applications which depend on a database. For example, a frontend application which communicates with a backend application over an API of some sort.  Once again, the answer is to decouple deployments of the applications to make sure that the frontend application is tolerant to additions to the backend API, and that similarly the backend API can add functionality without disrupting the frontend application’s operation. Another method of avoiding failures during deployments is to make write operations asynchronous by posting them to a message queue. That way, when the backend system which consumes from the queue is disabled during a deployment, the frontend does not start seeing errors; rather, it just sees an increase in the time taken to see a write reflected in further read operations. Once you have deployed your application, you should determine whether the application is working as expected. If it’s not working, the deployment can be cancelled or rolled back. The test used to determine this is often referred to as a “smoke test”. A good smoke test is simple and fast, and exercises not just the application but also all of its essential dependencies. For example, if an application needs a database to be present to operate effectively, the smoke test should exercise an application code path which will fail if the database is not present or returns an error. If and when the smoke test fails, you should know what your response will be. The simplest option is to manually roll back to a previous version of the application – which should be easy enough if you have a versioned artefact repository to draw the application from. A solution with more sophistication may automatically detect the smoke test failure and cancel the deployment or roll back to the previous version. An ideal solution would not even add the new version of the application to the production load balancer until it has been smoke tested and verified good. If the application fails the smoke test, it is simply discarded; no rollback is necessary, and no interruption in service happens. This works particularly well with the immutable server pattern. From time to time, there may come a situation where you wish to deploy to production right now. This may be due to a published security vulnerability in a library you are using, or because a bug has hit production which has broken the system for a number of users. It may be the case that you subvert your usual deployment pipeline to fix things, then back-port the change you made in production (or “hotfix”) to your development environment and push it through the normal deployment process once the crisis is over. Should this be the case, then your cycle time is too long. In the ensuing post-mortem analysis of what went wrong, you should ask questions about why the deployment pipeline was not streamlined enough to accommodate a rapid deployment of a fix to production.","description":"We’ve identified some common principles for software deployment\nwhich we’ve applied in a number of different projects, with\ndifferent technology stacks and needs.

Those with the title of designer may have a particular focus on one or more specific design disciplines – interaction, graphic, UX – but a good digital service needs talented, flexible designers to help build user-centred products. Designers, user researchers and front-end developers should work together in one team, designing in-browser. This is a better way of working, avoiding silos and ensuring that decisions are made with complete awareness of the implications. As a result, the people you hire should already have worked like this, or at least understand it. Depending on the types of project you are tackling you may require a team of designers with a range of different skills. A good first hire for a team tends to be a strong interaction designer, however adding designers with graphic design skills and designers who also have a background in undertaking user research can also give your team additional flexibility and capabilities. We strongly believe that design and user experience is the responsibility of the entire team and must be considered from the outset of the project through to and beyond going live. UX includes how fast the servers are, to how the copy is written, to how the layout is implemented in code, and what the structure of the URLs is. It’s worth looking at Frances Berriman’s talk on this. When building a team ask to see examples of work and ask the designers to explain their practical contribution. You should look for the designer to share stories and documentation that demonstrates how they have worked closely with other members of the team including developers, content designers, user researchers and stakeholders in an agile and iterative way. When evaluating their design work, it is important that the designer can explain a strong rationale for their design decision making that is based in supporting user needs. This ability to explain their rationale convincingly is more important than their ability to show polished wireframes or designs in their portfolio. Often a lack of polished designs in a portfolio can indicate that a designer is highly collaborative or has strong development skills, so take care not to focus only on polished comps or layouts. You should also ask the designer to talk about any significant differences between the design they present in their portfolio and the actual live design. It is important that designers create appropriate work and are able to persuade stakeholders and their team to make good design decisions.

No digital service can be effectively built, delivered, owned and operated without the technical skills to understand and improve the software enabling it. In order to provide the best service to your users it is vital that you are in a position to rapidly tailor that software to their needs and to the efficient running of the underlying systems.

Once a service is live the need for developers continues. There will always be technical optimisations that can be made – faster and more responsive systems, acting to mitigate the risks of a constantly changing security environment – but as you respond to new or more clearly understood user needs the software will need to adapt. As the policy and other context around a service changes the software may need to integrate with new systems or provide new features and a development team can help ensure that work is pro-active.

We require the ability to manage internal networks, each consisting of specific groups of virtual machines. This should allow for some virtual machines to not be internet accessible.

This is what Devops aims to correct. It is not a methodology or framework, but a set of principles and a willingness to break down silos. Specifically Devops is all about: Devops needs a change in attitude so shared ownership and collaboration are the common working practices in building and managing a service. This culture change is especially important for established organisations. Many business processes are ready to be automated. Automation removes manual, error-prone tasks – allowing people to concentrate on the quality of the service. Common areas that benefit from automation are: Data can be incredibly powerful for implementing change, especially when it’s used to get people from different groups involved in the quality of the end-to-end service delivery. Collecting information from different teams and being able to compare it across former silos can implement change on its own. People from different backgrounds (ie development and operations) often have different, but overlapping skill sets. Sharing between groups will spread an understanding of the different areas behind a successful service, so encourage it. Resolving issues will then be more about working together and not negotiating contracts. The quality of your service will be compromised if teams can’t work together, specifically: The root cause is often functional silos; when one group owns a specific area (say quality) it’s easy for other areas to assume that it’s no longer their concern.

These questions should be open ended, and structured in a manner that will help elicit information from respondents in a sensible flow. As suggested by the name, discussion guides should be used as a guide to the discussion, and in comparison with a structured questionnaire, questions and areas for coverage should not read out verbatim. This enables the discussion to be led by respondents’ own experience. Typically each section of the guide would include time guidance to ensure all areas can be covered and it should also indicate when stimulus is being used, and specify participants’ tasks.

Some email addresses are very long. Your email field should be able to fit at least 95% of email addresses. Two-thirds of the page width should be enough to do this, but analyse your user data to be sure. An email address is personal data that can easily be abused. Help to reassure users by making it clear what you will and won’t do with their address. This will also help users with multiple email addresses choose which one to provide. If a valid email address is required then you should help your users enter it correctly. The following techniques can help. Check that what they’ve entered conforms to the basic email address format. Check for common typos like ‘gnail’ instead of ‘gmail’ (read a case study here). Users may have a perfectly good reason for pasting an email address (for example if it’s very long). By doing this you may capture some accidental mis-types. It’s not failsafe though – users can make the same mistake twice, especially if they’re typing quickly (or just misremembered their email address). It also adds additional effort on to your users. An alternative way of helping users spot a mistyped email address is to play it back to them. Make sure it’s obvious how to correct any errors they might spot. If email is an integral part of your service, you can confirm whether the user has access to the email address they give you using an email confirmation loop.

Email confirmation loops can be a very disruptive user experience, forcing people to wait and then switch from a website to email and back again. They may not have access to their email at that point in time. Confirmation loops tend to increase drop-off rates, because some users struggle to complete the loop. They don’t notice the email, or it goes in to their spam folder, or they give up on the service before the email arrives. You decision should be based in part on what information you intend to send by email. Consider just helping users enter their email correctly instead. An email confirmation loop verifies that the address supplied by the user is a real one, but doesn’t verify that they alone own that address, or that they check it regularly.  Some users may supply temporary addresses as a way of getting around confirmation loops. Other people may share their account with someone else, or the account may have been hacked. For added security you can set an expiry date on the email, so that the link can’t be used after a certain time period. If the user attempts to use an expired link then they should be told this and given an opportunity to re-send a new link. There are two versions of the email confirmation loop. In the ‘blocking’ version the user cannot use the service until they have completed the loop. In the ‘non-blocking’ version they can continue to use the service, but will be reminded regularly that they need to confirm their email. Some functionality may not be available until they have done this. Blocking loops have a slightly simpler flow, but if the users can’t complete the loop they’re unable to use the service at all. It’s especially important that the emails are sent instantly. Non-blocking loops require more careful design, and you can’t guarantee that all users emails are confirmed, but there’s no risk that the loop will stop people from accessing your service. Some services start users in a non-blocking loop initially and then transition to a blocking loop. Use the phrase ‘Activate your account’ to describe the process of confirming an email address. The activate your account page should be shown immediately after the user provides their email address, or if they try to sign in before confirming their email. It should: For blocking loops this should be the only page the user sees if they try to sign in before activating their account. For non-blocking loops, if a user signs in before activating their account, you should: When a user clicks on the link in the activation email take them to a page that confirms that they have activated their account.

The aim is to gather insight into how people live; what they do; how they use things; or what they need in their everyday or professional lives. Ethnographic research relies on techniques such as observation, video diaries, photographs, contextual interviews, and analysis of artefacts such as for example devices, tools or paper forms that might be used as part of a person’s job. Observations can be made at home, at work, or in leisure environments. People can be studied with their family, on their own, with work colleagues, or as part of a group of friends. Often one participant may be recruited, but several more may be studied as part of that person’s family or friends. Data collection can range from a 4-5 hour contextual interview, through to following a participant for several days, or even a longitudinal study over several weeks or months to investigate, for example, how a particular product or service might be used over time. It doesn’t necessarily involve ‘full immersion’ in a person’s life: it can involve a depth interview in a person’s home or it might involve a person simply maintaining their own video diary over a period of time. Ethnographic research can provide extremely rich insight into ‘real life’ behaviour, and can be used to identify new or currently unmet user needs. This approach is most valuable at the beginning of a project when there is a need to understand real end user needs, or to understand the constraints of using a new product or service by a particular audience. Ethnographic research can provide a significant amount of qualitative data, and analysis can be time consuming. NOTE: The term ‘ethnographic’ can be misused, it’s currently a bit of a ‘buzzword’ with some agencies who may not fully understand the approach.  It is recommended that a specialist agency is used, who can demonstrate successful case studies (collecting and analysing the data). In principle, anyone could participate in this type of research. As with any user research, the recruitment of suitable participants is key. The full implications of the research should be fully explained to potential participants, as some may not feel comfortable with this level of intrusion in their lives. Depending on the study needs and the approach, but 6-8 weeks from briefing to results can provide rich insight. It may take time to build trust with participants, and the analysis period needs to be sufficient to be thorough. Ethnographic research can be expensive and time consuming, but this depends on the needs of a particular project. The benefits derived can be extremely valuable.","description":"Ethnographic research usually involves observing target users in their natural, real-world setting,  rather than in the artificial environment of a lab or focus group.

An ‘expert’ usability evaluator can assess a product (or web site) against a known set of ‘heuristics’, or usability guidelines (best practice). An alternative approach is to conduct a ‘cognitive walkthrough’ against specific use cases or scenarios. Ideally two usability experts will conduct the review independently, and then meet to discuss and agree the findings before making recommendations to the service manager. A list of widely accepted (although not necessarily validated) heuristics are provided by Jakob Nielsen or an alternative set can be found in the International Standard ISO 9241. A ‘cognitive walkthrough’ is a usability inspection that aims to identify usability issues by focusing on how easy it is for users to accomplish specific tasks with the system (or website). This method starts with identifying the user goals, then conducting a task analysis to specify the sequence of steps or actions required to achieve each task. The usability expert, along with designers and developers, then walks through these identified steps to assess the extent to which a user can achieve their goal. Both of these approaches can be used to evaluate an existing product or website, or as a quick, low cost method of evaluating a product in development. These approaches can be considered to be ‘better than nothing’, but will never provide the same quality insight as testing with real end users. However, a competent usability specialist will often identify issues that are subsequently seen in traditional user testing or in actual use. Some agencies conduct expert reviews as the first step of all usability projects. The fundamental weakness of any expert review is that it doesn’t involve use by real end users. Some people may therefore consider this to be purely opinion, but input from an experienced usability expert is better than no user testing at all. For a simple website application this could be turned around in 1-2 days.","description":"Expert reviews – also known as heuristic evaluations – are low cost usability methods that don’t involve participation of real end users.

There are no instructions to follow because you’re not looking into anything specific. For this reason exploratory testing is sometimes referred to as unscripted testing. Unlike following a script to test a predetermined outcome, exploratory testing relies on a tester’s knowledge, experience and intuition to fully check a system. Exploratory testing: detects subtle or complex bugs in a system (that are not detected in targeted testing) provides user-oriented feedback to developers and business analysts Exploratory testing aims to find new and undiscovered problems. This contrasts with other more prescribed methods of testing, such as test automation, which aims to show scripted tests can complete successfully without defects. Practitioners tend to avoid describing exploratory testing as ‘ad hoc’ as this implies the testing is unplanned, unstructured and unfocused. Exploratory testing is a disciplined approach and requires specific techniques. State a goal for each testing session and document the session as it progresses, particularly when you identify defects. Exploratory testing is ideally performed by experienced testers as they tend to have: analytical skills an ability to behave like users a knack of finding defects If you’re an experienced tester, you’ll easily adapt to exploratory testing without prior knowledge of the field. On-the-job-training, mentoring or reading about the discipline can help you prepare for your first test. You can carry out exploratory testing in isolation, allowing yourself to focus on what the system does rather than what it ought to do. Alternatively, you can often achieve good results working alongside developers and business analysts, who can offer insights into system functionality or intended user journeys. Exploratory testing works best on a system that holds enough functionality for you to interact with in a meaningful way. The system needs to be relatively stable and mature, but you can prioritise your development activities so you can do exploratory testing as early as possible, eg build functionality in slices so you can test from start to finish as early as possible. Apply the techniques of test charters, mind maps and timeboxing to achieve best practice during exploratory testing. These techniques will put some general restrictions around your testing, helping you judge whether it’s a success. Test charters give exploratory testing sessions a mission without being prescriptive, eg a charter won’t detail what problems you’re looking for. Your charter can outline: what parts of the system you’ll be looking at (also known as your mission scope) your testing goals, eg make sure a system is secure enough for people to use details of the team doing the exploratory testing the date and times of the testing the test environment, eg the software you’ll use to do the test mock data you’ll need for testing, eg a mock username or password As the exploratory testing session progresses, update the charter to log any observations or issues you’ve come across and note down ideas for further testing. Mind maps follow a similar approach to test charters but display the information graphically. Mind-maps are seen as appropriate for exploratory testing as they reflect the non-linear nature of the session. You can limit your exploratory test session to a set timescale, a practice also known as timeboxing. This can help you focus on the project’s specific goals and scope, rather than drift into unfocused exploration. More on these techniques can be found in an article posted online by Jonathan Bach: http://www.satisfice.com/articles/sbtm.pdf Document all your queries and observations during the exploratory testing session. Capture the evidence as notes, screenshots and log files to help the testing be replicated or further investigated. An exploratory test that discovers a bug can be developed into a test scenario and automated. When you need to formally document the outcome of a session, your report may include: a charter features tested notes on how testing was conducted notes on any bugs found list of issues (questions and concerns about the product or project that have arisen during testing) extra materials used to support testing You can also report how much of the exploratory testing session you spent on each different activity, including: creating and executing tests investigating and reporting bugs setting up the session There are many different tools you can use for exploratory testing, eg fully automated video capture and logging tools, planning tools, or walls full of process diagrams and feature descriptions. However, the only tools you need are a pen and some paper. The better tools are nice to have, but don’t put off your testing if you don’t have access to them.","description":"The goal of exploratory testing is to explore a system as a user would, possibly finding new defects as you go.","link":"/service-manual/making-software/exploratory-testing.html"},{"_type":"manual_section","organisations":["government-digital-service"],"manual":"service-manual","title":"Government Service Design Manual: Failing to meet the standard","indexable_content":"Failure during service design Failure to pass a Digital by Default assessment Ongoing performance during the service’s design after a review at GDS prior to going live when live, if it falls below the performance targets approved at launch A service may fail to meet the standard at three points: If a service isn’t being designed inline with the standard, or there is no public written record of progress, GDS will raise the issue with you and the digital leader and suggest action.

Sprints are about planning what you and your team will achieve and when you will achieve it by. Each member of your team should have a task to complete within each sprint. Each sprint is of equal length and usually lasts between 1 to 2 weeks, but you can use longer or shorter sprints in your project. When deciding the length of your sprints, consider: Start the process with a sprint 0. This sprint is about preparing your team for the first sprint. Use a sprint 0 to: While there are other agile methodologies that don’t rely on sprinting, such as Kanban, it’s common for teams to start with Scrum. Agile processes have 4 different types of regular meetings: Have daily meetings with your team lasting no more than 15 minutes. It’s best if you do it standing up, in a semicircle, in front of your project wall. This will help you to keep it short and allows your team members to point at user story cards on the wall to keep things on topic. Each member of your team should answer: Ask people to keep it brief and don’t be afraid to remind them of this. If people try to solve issues during the stand-up, stop the conversation and arrange a huddle after the stand-up to discuss in a smaller group. Sprint planning is done at the start of each sprint. It requires user stories to have been written in advance with acceptance criteria. The product owner should read out the stories and explain the acceptance criteria in order of priority. It’s the job of the team to: A good description of sprint planning is on the Agile Learning Labs website, explaining its 2 parts: This meeting can be hard to get right with large teams. Some people want to dig deep and question every story; others want to keep moving and don’t want to go into detail. Persevere! This is a chance for team members to demonstrate the work they’ve produced during the sprint. You can include stakeholders in this meeting and also use it to inform stakeholders which user stories haven’t been completed and why. These meetings are important opportunities to iterate the team’s working process. Learn how to run retrospectives.

A focus group is normally made up of 6-12 people, although sometimes mini groups are favoured (4-5 people) as they can lead to a greater depth of discussion. 1:1 interviews are conducted by a moderator with a single respondent, and sometimes these are conducted over the phone. Interviews and discussion groups are both facilitated by a trained moderator using a specially designed topic guide in order to ensure the discussion is focused and keeps on topic. Sessions normally last 1-2 hours and will often involve participants being shown stimulus – eg communications materials to inform discussion, and sessions may include interactive techniques eg role play scenarios. Focus groups and 1:1 interviews are useful techniques for exploring and mapping reasons for attitudes and behaviour, understanding how target audiences approach issues or may be encouraged to change. They also enable participants reactions to be monitored, and the moderator to probe interesting issues when necessary. Dedicated viewing facilities are often used that enable sessions to be recorded, and interested parties can observe the sessions (often via a two way mirror) in a separate room to the participants. This often results in the research having more credibility as interested parties will have been able to view the sessions, and witness the findings first hand – this also means key issues can be acted upon quicker as observers can feed straight back to their teams. Some sessions take place in community settings, encouraging less confident/harder-to-reach audiences to attend. Focus groups can also be conducted online. The number of groups is often dictated by the budget available, but the average project will have 4 to 6 groups, with larger ones having between 10 and 20. Besides budget, other factors that influence the number of groups used are the number of potential users groups that need to be covered, and the number of geographic areas. Focus groups and 1:1 interviews can be expensive compared with other types of research, while the small samples size means that findings are not statistically significant. There is, therefore, a risk of generalising across audience groups. Analysis of the sessions can also be time consuming. Moderators also need to build a rapport with respondents. If he or she fails to do this, and can’t control the group adequately, it can result in the sessions being dominated by one or two participants, and biased data being collected. Participants can be obtained from the general population and hard to reach groups.","description":"Focus groups, mini groups, and 1:1 interviews involve unstructured interviews or group discussion.","link":"/service-manual/user-centred-design/user-research/focus-groups-mini-groups-interviews.html"},{"_type":"manual_section","organisations":["government-digital-service"],"manual":"service-manual","title":"Government Service Design Manual: Form structure","indexable_content":"1.

How do you get back to the current question once you’ve edited a previous one?       Do you lose all your answers to questions that follow the one you go back to edit?         Does the current question stay open or closed? How do you get back to the current question once you’ve edited a previous one? Do you lose all your answers to questions that follow the one you go back to edit? Choose a structure for your forms that most naturally fits the way people need to use them. You can use a question or statement format.  For example ‘What is your date of birth?’ or ‘Date of birth’. Just remember to be consistent across the transaction. Guidance: Ask yourself: Thinking about the above will help you decide on an appropriate structure. Here are some of the more common approaches: All questions are placed on a single page.  The good: The bad: Each question goes on its own page.  The good: The bad: All questions on a single page, but each new question only appears once the previous section has been completed.  The good: The bad: Done well, option 3 is a hybrid of the other two that has benefits of both the other options. Within this hybrid option there are still some important design decisions to make. For example: For more complicated transactions, some combination of the other options might be your best bet.  Again, done well this can give you the benefits of both the single page and wizard approaches. It also allows you to create a sense of rhythm to the overall flow, which can help people to understand when they have moved into a different part of the transaction, and break up the monotony of filling in forms. As always, these design decisions must have a strong, user-centred rationale behind them.

You’ll need to get approval at different phases when you build your service.  Discovery is right at the start of your project — where you research user needs, find out about any policy or technological constraints and get a picture of what your first prototypes will explore. During the alpha phase, you start building and testing those prototypes. To start discovery, you need approval for discovery and alpha. This means: investment approval from your department Cabinet Office spend control approval to spend on external resources, eg on suppliers You don’t normally need a detailed business case for discovery and alpha because they inform the development of the bigger investment case for beta and live. As a guide, discovery and alpha together shouldn’t cost over £750,000. If you plan to go above this, you should question whether you’ve sized the discovery and alpha correctly — if you do exceed this figure you’ll need a detailed business case. The beta phase is where you build a fully working prototype that you’ll test in public. The live phase is when your public beta has been tested and is ready to release. To go to beta you’ll need approval for beta and live. This means: investment approval from your department Cabinet Office spend control approval to spend on external resources, eg on suppliers any other approvals specific to your service eg headcount or salary/grade changes You need to submit a business case to HM Treasury (HM Treasury published guidance) if any of following apply: your anticipated total spend on the entire programme (including non-digital aspects) is higher than your organisation’s delegated authority as set by HM Treasury your digital spend is above £10 million If you need to approach HM Treasury and your digital spend is below £10 million, just include it concisely within your programme business case rather than writing a separate business case for it. HM Treasury has introduced the ‘programme business case’, where detail can be added by phase. This is because agile delivery: typically enables smaller, more frequent funding approvals may form part of a larger programme of transformational change The programme business case can be used for projects or programmes that have agile delivery elements. It replaces the traditional approval process (strategic outline case followed by outline business case and full business case). However, these still apply for large investment decisions involving lengthy public sector OJEU (Official Journal of the European Union) procurement processes.

Sex is a protected characteristic in the Equalities Act 2010. Gender isn’t, but the closely related concept of gender reassignment is. Treating people differently because of protected characteristics may be discrimination and may therefore be illegal. The act applies to the public sector and to services. Many people consider that questions about gender or sex are sensitive or inappropriate in a government context.  For people who are coming to terms with differences between their sex and gender, being asked about sex or gender may be particularly difficult and stressful.  Sex is biologically determined, and can be male, female, or intersex. Gender is a social construct about how people choose to present themselves in the world.  Trying to guess someone’s gender from a title is a bad idea because: Do not collect title as a required answer, due to the huge variety of titles in use. Gender is not a clearly defined ‘female’ or ‘male’ construct. It can include a range of identities in-between, and labels identifying these identities are still in a state of flux.  Some people may also be in transition, or move between different genders frequently. This makes it difficult to provide sensible options on a form.  For a few people, being forced to declare themselves as ‘female’ or ‘male’ may lead to dropping out of a form.  Historically, the assumption was that ‘men’ came before ‘women’ so the traditional order of options has been ‘male first’. This is no-longer appropriate as an automatic assumption. Please test with ‘female’ as the first option and report your findings on the wiki. It is only appropriate to ask for someone’s sex in a context where the biological data is necessary – typically, only for medical transactions. Unfortunately, we also have to recognise that we have to deal with legislation that may require ‘sex’ as a legal identifier. If you must ask for ‘sex’ then ask for ‘female’, ‘male’ and at least 1 of the remaining options, depending on circumstances: In the UK an Early Day Motion has been submitted in support of giving legal recognition to those who do not associate with a particular gender. In Germany, the Personal Status Law (paragraph 22) states that if a child’s sex cannot be determined at birth then the law allows for birth to be registered with the ‘sex’ box left blank. The Australian Government guidelines on sex and gender specify that when a government form asks about sex or gender, then it must provide these options: M (male), F (female) or X (Indeterminate/Intersex/Unspecified).

They are: Don’t slow down delivery Decisions when they’re needed, at the right level Do it with the right people Go see for yourself Only do it if it adds value Trust and verify We help build services that are continually improved to meet user needs. This means: unblocking anything that slows down delivery where the delivery team doesn’t have the authority to do so being available when needed — throughout service delivery being mindful of the balance between features and quality making decisions to keep pace with delivery teams We gauge success through delivery of services that meet user needs. Governing well means: actively seeking out delivery impediments, being accountable for them and removing them before they affect teams protecting the team from, or helping them handle, external pressures — service teams will be familiar with these! A bit more detail Transition between the 5 phases of service delivery should be seamless, so people who govern must anticipate problems and make timely decisions to allow this. Governance is also about creating an environment where people can thrive. We have a flat organisation structure so everyone can contribute to the success of the team. Embrace that things change. Make sure: decision making is evidence-based and focused on meeting user needs the service manager and team have the authority to make decisions and only escalate when they need to you handle change and improve quality through continuous iterative development people who govern keep up with the pace of delivery by having short, frequent meetings high impact, high probability risks are managed when needed, and our controls (eg on spending) are based on the balance between costs and benefits A bit more detail Services will only succeed if we recognise that user needs emerge and change throughout a service’s life. This means that a service team can’t define a set of features at inception and expect them to stay the same. People who govern should support this ‘evolutionary’ model of development, recognising that change is inevitable and can’t be eliminated or designed away. They should also ensure that service teams know: that they have the authority to make decisions about the service what the boundaries of that decision making are who is accountable for helping them when decisions outside the boundaries need to be made Iterative development is the best way of handling change and improving service quality. We can support this by devolving decision making to service teams and by unblocking them quickly for decisions that haven’t yet been devolved. People who govern should also participate in regular delivery meetings like stand-ups and sprint planning. This makes sure they’re fully informed and can make decisions quickly. It also improves the ways they communicate and work with delivery teams. We know we can’t eliminate or transfer risks. We encourage highlighting and owning them, but we only actively manage risks that could tangibly affect service delivery. Our approach to risk management isn’t about scheduled discussion of a risk register — it’s about dealing with risk at the right time. We identify the best possible moment to respond to important risks and only then start to plan and carry out our response.  Everyone involved is: capable, motivated and empowered focused on goals and key performance indicators (KPIs) open and honest about what they do Trust people to organise and work towards team goals to get the job done so that services continue to improve in response to user needs. A bit more detail The only people who should have governance responsibility are those who can: make the right decisions steer and assure both delivery and quality They contribute by supporting the delivery team to bring in the right people, in the right environment, at the right time. Services are developed by multi‑disciplinary delivery teams where people have different skills and roles to achieve the team goals. They can include technical experts, business people and may also include legal and policy staff. Teams should keep the same service manager but the specialist skills needed will change as the service develops, so the makeup of the team will change. We make sure delivery teams have all the skills they need — and we provide them with the environment, workspace and tools to collaborate, organise and deliver. Teams benefit from sitting close together — do everything you can to co‑locate. By visiting delivery teams, you can see the value that’s being created for yourself. It’s everyone’s responsibility to stay well informed. We talk face to face wherever possible, and the best way to measure progress is to ‘see the thing’. This means going to regular service demonstrations and giving feedback. A bit more detail We use what the delivery team is already producing for reporting. So we’ll look at things like their wall, sprint reports and demos to get information instead of longer, formal reports. We regularly plan together. We visit teams to find out and openly and honestly discuss: what they’re working on right now plans for the future what blockers they face The best way to gauge progress, check on the mood of the delivery team and assure a service is by meeting them face-to-face in their workspace. There are several ways to do this without adding overhead. These include: at daily stand-up meetings — these last 10 to 15 minutes and team members give updates on work completed the previous day, work being taken on that day, and any blockers regular planning sessions at the beginning of each iteration, where the team commits to work to be done  regular reviews or show and tells at the end of each iteration to show work completed in that iteration and discuss any issues or changes that need to be made to the service regular retrospectives, where the team can reflect on what went well, what didn’t and anything they should change People who govern should regularly take part in these meetings, if only to observe. Going to see for yourself, and looking at data that delivery teams are already using to manage delivery, should give you the information you need to govern. If these meetings aren’t happening, find out why. If they are, you should go along if you have governance responsibility for that service. Delivery managers should collect data during these meetings to use for simple, highly visual reports. These should be displayed where people can easily see them, such as the team walls or the service’s wiki/collaboration tool. The reports will help frame discussions at future meetings. Walls are an excellent way to track work and show important things, like what the team is doing and how they’re progressing. It helps planning and communication, within the team and to others. Delivery teams should make sure that their walls are up to date and being used. Visiting a team’s wall gives a current view of its work without anyone needing to produce lengthy reports that take the focus away from delivery. You should take the time to visit them regularly.  We keep user needs at the forefront of everything we do and focus on delivering value early and continuously. This means: we set out a clear vision and measures of success — and we communicate these regularly we value quality and making sure that user needs are met — and we give the team time to do this we explore and develop ideas that could add value — and if they don’t work, we stop A bit more detail ‘Delivering value’ means introducing a quality service that meets user needs and doing that in an incremental manner. Service delivery — through discovery, alpha, beta and to live — is the most effective and efficient way of understanding user needs and getting a service into users’ hands. Good governance allows us to do this as quickly as possible by focussing delivery teams on developing things that meet their needs. Governance decisions, like service delivery decisions, should always be evidence‑driven. The service delivery team should develop a charter that describes: their service vision quantifiable goals key performance indicators (KPIs) that show progress against meeting user needs and organisational goals Governance teams collaborate on the development of this charter and help to build consensus and understanding of it across the organisation and in third parties. Service development is a learning process — and we add value when we learn. Everyone should be encouraged to create better ways to meet user needs. Even if something doesn’t quite work in user research, the lessons learned will guide further service development. This avoids creating an expensive dead-end that doesn’t meet user needs.  We build simple, supportive governance that trusts individuals and empowers teams so they can focus on delivering. We regularly speak to the team so that we can help to support, steer and assure. To monitor progress, we use a light touch, checking services a little, but very often. We focus on outcomes from delivery and identify areas for improvement. A bit more detail To create the right environment for the delivery team to flourish we form teams with the right mix of people, supporting rather than slowing down delivery and empowering decision makers. Frequent interaction with the team provides regular opportunities for people who govern to support, steer and assure rather than waiting for less frequent, formal meetings. Regular reflection on how we’re doing and finding ways to improve is an important part of good governance. At the end of each iteration every delivery team holds a retrospective where it discusses lessons learned — both what went well and what didn’t. This lets us identify actions which are planned into future iterations. Retrospectives should also be used across programmes of work.

As soon as you have more than one team you’ll need shared planning, coordination and management of dependencies. This can mean a small increase in the amount of work, but don’t lose sight of the aim to have self organising, self managed teams. Scaling up doesn’t mean you need to add more people who govern; don’t complicate governance processes as you scale. You need to: make sure everyone understands the service vision and goals — especially new starters have teams plan together and think about what they’ll individually be responsible for where possible look at splitting work by theme, product or feature sets to minimise dependencies between teams think about whether it makes sense to share specialist people across teams, eg software architects and people working in security, policy or finance It’s better for multiple teams to be sitting in the same location — just as a single team benefits from this. When your teams don’t sit together: there are communication overheads there’s less informal communication and learning it’s harder to establish a shared culture This is particularly problematic when ‘business’ and delivery team members don’t sit together. If you can’t find a suitable shared space or team members live and work in different parts of the country, split the team. There are ways to minimise the problems separation causes, eg: video communication social media regular face-to-face meetings You can also get team representatives together in a cross team stand up (sometimes called a ‘stand up of stand ups’), where the following questions are explored: what has your team done since we last met? what will your team do before we meet again? is anything slowing your team down or getting in their way? are you about to do something that will affect another team’s plans? The last question helps teams to gain early sight of any dependencies or cross team issues that will need joint remedy. The frequency of these meetings is best determined by the teams and the pace of delivery. It’s important to plan for changes in team composition. Planning activities include:  consulting with the delivery team on who should be added when making sure the team can devote time to integrating new people making sure new people will have the tools they need to be productive on the day they arrive When you have more teams, don’t force them to work in exactly the same way as each other. Delivery teams work best when they can control how they work.

Even if it hasn’t changed, it’s important to revisit it in this phase as your team is likely to change or expand.  Doing this helps ensure everyone understands: what the service is why it’s important who it’s important to Review your governance arrangements Your team may take on a different shape as you start to build a prototype. As the team and goals change, make sure your governance team is still closely involved in supporting the team delivering the service. Identify and mitigate risks A crucial outcome of the alpha phase is that the team can identify the biggest risks to the service early on. Things that may help manage risks include using iterations to test incrementally and adding critical risks to the team wall. Find out more about identifying risks during alpha. Create a roadmap based on the outcome of your discovery We use roadmaps to describe the high level direction a service will take. Roadmaps need a firm vision with goals that are focused on outcomes.  It’s important to establish goals during discovery and create the roadmap with the team. The roadmap will inform the business case. Your roadmap may identify that the service is broken up into a number of segments, each of which have their own beta phase and then get separately put into live service. Find out more about identifying goals during alpha. Measure your progress You should use the measures you agreed to use during discovery. If you decide to measure progress in a different way, you need to make sure this is really necessary and get everyone involved in the decision to change. The team wall is how delivery teams manage their work — it’s essential everyone understands how the wall can help show progress. Go to show and tells A show and tell is where the team demonstrates progress by showing what they’ve been doing. It’s an opportunity to ensure user needs are being met.  The team may ask for help in unblocking something, or need a decision on something that needs your steer. Clarify benefits By testing prototypes with users you will verify whether or not the expected benefits can be realised. Some examples of benefits from digital services include: making it easier and quicker for users to register for and use a service  reduction of print and post costs more accurate user data cost reduction through labour saving Identify costs for beta and live Consider the expected lifetime of the service and costs for: people software technical infrastructure  team environment (facilities) and support continuous improvement assisted digital Revisit procurement needs You need to evaluate the size of team you need for beta and get costs for things like cloud services and tools needed for development so you can build a set of costs for spend approval and the business case. Rate cards and price lists available in procurement frameworks can help you estimate costs, as can actual spend data of similar services. Develop your business case and get approval If you haven’t already appointed a senior responsible officer (SRO), should appoint one now to sponsor the business case. This could be the service manager or someone else senior in the business. Seek funding for your digital service with a business case for further investment approval and Cabinet Office spend control approvals. You can’t start beta until you have an approved business case. Digital by default service standard assessment The Digital by Default Service Standard is a set of criteria for digital teams building government services to meet. Meeting the standard will mean digital services are of a consistently high quality.  This includes creating services that are easily improved, safe, secure and fulfill user needs. The result of an assessment could mean you continue to build towards a beta service, make some changes and come back for re-assessment or stop what you are doing. Plan for assurance In addition to the in built assurance activities at the team level (eg pairing, show and tells, user research and retrospectives), you can use your department’s internal assurance team to provide an independent view. A valuable side-effect of this assurance can be identifying potential opportunities and dependencies with other departmental initiatives that could impact your service development. If your service is, or is part of, a major project then you’ll have developed an Integrated Approval and Assurance Plan that defines appropriate assurance activities. In these circumstances you’d also expect to have a Major Projects Authority (MPA) Project Assessment Review towards the end of alpha to help the shaping of beta and the development and approval of your business case. Even if you’re not subject to MPA assurance, you should include assurance and approval points in your service roadmap. Unblock and support the team Teams need help with things that slow them down and are outside of their control. During alpha they’ll need you to be closely involved on a daily basis, so that you can help them with decisions, encouragement and ideas. You’ll need to anticipate problems and make decisions promptly to avoid slowing down delivery and ensure a seamless transition from the alpha to beta phase. Revisit the size and shape of the team You’ll probably need more user researchers, developers and designers to help deliver your alpha, particularly as you start building prototypes of the service. You may also need finance people, economists and analysts to help with your business case. During alpha you’ll also need to work out the team structure and composition you need for beta and beyond.  Consider if you need to scale At this point your team may need to think about adding more people and how that will affect delivery. Review team needs As your team changes, it’s important to revisit their needs. New skills may mean new tools, and new people will certainly mean more space and equipment. Remember to keep the service team seated together so that they can work closely. Find out how to get the right working environment.

You’ll have investigated risks and gained a more thorough understanding of your users and their needs. Review governance You should review the governance arrangements you’ll need for the beta service, bearing in mind that you may have multiple teams working towards a common set of objectives. Keep your governance arrangements as lightweight as possible whilst still supporting development of the service. Plan for known risks A successful alpha will have investigated most of the areas of risk and uncertainty in your service. Use this to inform your roadmap and try to identify and plan for risks that are specific to beta. Including risks in your roadmap will help you focus on the risks that are relevant to delivery. Measure progress The most important measures of progress are seeing the service being delivered and user satisfaction. The team wall is another useful way of seeing how delivery is progressing — it’s essential everyone understands how the wall can help show progress. Find out more about how to decide what to measure. Keep going to show and tells This is where the team demonstrates progress by showing what they’ve been doing. It’s an opportunity to ensure user needs are being met. The team may ask for help in unblocking something, or need a decision on something that needs your steer. Test benefits In beta you’ll be delivering a working, public facing version of the service. This phase is an opportunity to test expected benefits with users. Review costs for beta and live Consider the expected lifetime of the service and costs for: people software technical infrastructure  team environment (facilities) and support continuous improvement assisted digital As you progress in beta you should get a much clearer picture of live service costs. Revisit procurement needs As your understanding of what is needed for live service improves, you may discover, for example, that you need more people, different skills or changing cloud service requirements. Adjust your procurement accordingly. Get department investment approval and Cabinet Office spend approval for beta and live Seek further approval for funding your digital service as necessary. Digital by Default Service Standard assessment The Digital by Default Service Standard (DbDSS) is a set of criteria for digital teams building government services to meet. Meeting the standard will mean digital services are of a consistently high quality. This includes creating services that are easily improved, safe, secure and fulfill user needs. The result of an assessment could mean you continue to build towards a beta service, make some changes and come back for re-assessment or stop what you are doing. Assurance and audit As you move through beta towards live, the typical assurance processes to get your business ready to run the live service are applicable. There is a strong link to the DbDSS assessment at the beta to live point and it’s worth considering any additional assurance that may be beneficial beyond the scope of that assessment.  This is likely to focus more on the business impact of introducing the new service, or new digital service channel, and any associated transition arrangements. Any audit of beta should focus on the team and governance process and behaviour, not the actual decisions taken. The team and its governance bodies can only be expected to make decisions based on what’s known at the time. A decision may be found to be wrong as better information becomes available, eg through testing with users.  If your service development team is working well, it will quickly learn and modify its approach. Unblock and support the team Teams need help with things that slow them down and are outside of their control. During beta they’ll need you to be closely involved on a daily basis, so that you can help them with decisions, encouragement and ideas. You’ll need to anticipate problems and make decisions promptly to avoid slowing down delivery. Revisit the size and shape of the team You’ll probably need a larger team with a broader range of skills to help as you start building the beta service. You should consider if you need business analysis, product management, operations or programme delivery management skills. Find out more about beta team requirements. Scale as necessary Scaling to more than one team brings overheads. It’s important to start small and stay small unless you really need to get bigger. And if you do, plan for these overheads and you’ll get better results. Review the team environment As your team changes it’s important to revisit their needs. New skills may mean new tools, and new people will certainly mean more space and equipment. Remember to keep the service teams seated together so that they can work more closely.

If your service is in response to a new policy, make sure you consider the digital service during the policy impact assessment.  You need to set up proportionate governance for discovery – you’ll need to consider: delivery and assurance funding and approvals the service delivery team Governance during the discovery phase will include a small team of senior people acting as sponsors and advisors. They’ll be closely involved with the delivery team exploring the service needs during discovery. Plan for your discovery Before discovery, you need to plan and gather sufficient information to make sure what you’re doing fits with the wider organisational strategy.  You need to: develop a service vision laying out the overall intention of the service, including who the users are and why the service is important  agree a handful of discovery goals and how to measure progress find out who the stakeholders are set up initial governance and communicate what people can expect from it Goals and measures are likely to be incomplete and there may be little evidence on which to base targets. Your service vision will probably evolve too. Go to show and tells ‘Seeing the thing’ at show and tells is an important governance activity – this is useful because: the team can demonstrate progress towards meeting discovery goals you can see how the well they are working together you can support and help unblock things that are slowing them down Even early in the life of a service, there’s a lot that the team can show to demonstrate the outcomes of their work. Identify benefits In discovery you’ll spend some time exploring and understanding what benefits the service could bring to users and government. You’ll do this through lots of user research and a close analysis of policies, laws and business needs.  If you don’t identify benefits from the start, the chances of them being realised are reduced. Different delivery options may offer different benefits – so identify the options in discovery and explore further during alpha. Identify costs for discovery and alpha Consider the costs for: people software infrastructure team environment and facilities You’ll probably need to bring in additional skills at different points. You’ll also need: design and development tools a user research lab (possibly)  a large stock of whiteboards, sticky notes and pens Rate cards and price lists available in procurement frameworks can help you estimate costs. Evolve the service vision The service vision should state: what the service is and who it is for key benefits it provides how success will be measured  how it fits in with organisational strategy It may also contain known risks and constraints. Get approval Get department investment approval and Cabinet Office spend approval for discovery and alpha. There’s more information about this in the guidance on funding your digital service. Consider procurement needs Involve procurement and HR during discovery to ensure there is no lag between discovery and alpha. They’ll help you secure the resources and people needed. Make a decision to proceed or not Discovery has 4 possible outcomes – you can decide to: stop extend discovery (if you haven’t found out enough yet) restart discovery (if you need to investigate something completely different) proceed to alpha You should use the outputs from discovery to help you decide. You can make the decision to stop at any point during discovery. Set up your discovery team You’ll need a small team consisting of your stakeholders and any core team members that have been identified, including the service manager and potentially policy, procurement, HR and legal as required.

Any changes to the service should be based on emerging user needs and operating context (eg legislative or technological changes, espionage or criminal threats to the service). A service being continually improved is a condition of a service being on GOV.UK. Review your governance arrangements You should review what governance arrangements you’ll need for the live service, bearing in mind this covers both running the live service and improving the service. Plan for known risks By the time you’re running a live service, most of your delivery risks will have been dealt with in earlier phases. However, it’s important to understand what risks can affect the success of your service and the benefits it’s expected to deliver. Continue to work in an agile way You should continue to run show and tells to provide opportunities to demonstrate new and changed features. The team may ask for help in unblocking something or a decision on something that needs your steer. Retrospectives still provide valuable opportunities for reflection, learning and improvement in live operation. They might focus on the service operation in the broadest sense or specific activities like introducing new or improved features. If you have more than one service, you could look at ways of having larger retrospectives where the services share how they are working, what’s working well for them and what isn’t. Review benefits You should now be getting the benefits you expected. You’ll have a service dashboard on the performance platform which will show actual take-up of the digital service. You can compare its figures against those you predicted in the business case and find out if you are on track or not. You should also be: reviewing actual cost savings (eg less support calls, reduced administrative time spent on processing transactions) and deciding when to realise these by scaling back operations checking your assumptions about assisted digital and finding out whether its users are the expected demographic decommissioning obsolete systems Funding and approvals The business case for the service should cover development plus the first 2 years of live operation, including continuous iterative improvement.  Beyond this, you need to consider the budget demands for the live service as part of the department’s usual budgetary process. The funding should cover ongoing improvement and any minor changes needed to remain compliant with legislation. If the service needs a major overhaul, you should treat this as a new service development and start again with discovery. Revisit procurement needs Identify any external resource needs for live operation and ensure that investment and spend control approvals are secured to enable procurement activity to progress. The Government Digital Strategy aims to build in-house capability, so the need to procure external capability should reduce over time. Assurance and audit Part of assurance is reviewing whether or not expected benefits are being realised. You can use your department’s internal audit team to run reviews and the Major Projects Authority (MPA) will assure major projects. The National Audit Office audits most public-sector bodies in the UK and produces value for money reports into the implementation of government policies, so you may find that it does this for your service. Revisit the size and shape of the team During live service operation your team may need to change size and shape in response to user needs and operating context. Teams will expand and contract over the service lifetime. Find out more about live team requirements Ensure the team has skills necessary to run the live service It’s important the live service continues to improve. If you need to introduce new team members, you should manage this sensitively and gradually, in a way that allows them to gain confidence that they have the skills to continue development of the service. Review the team environment As your team changes it’s important to revisit their needs.

The term ‘guerrilla’ refers to its ‘out in the wild’ style, in the fact that it can be conducted anywhere eg cafe, library, train station etc, essentially anywhere where there is significant footfall. Guerrilla testing works well to quickly validate how effective a design is on its intended audience, whether certain functionality works in the way it is supposed to, or even establishing whether a brand or proposition is clear. This approach is quick and relatively easy to set up. Participants are not recruited but are ‘approached’ by those persons conducting the sessions. The sessions themselves are short, typically between 15-30 minutes and are loosely structured around specific key research objectives. The output is typically ‘qualitative’ so insight is often rich and detailed. Anyone on the service team can conduct ‘guerrilla testing’ on their site or service but often the best scenario is for a researcher to run the sessions with the designer or developer. The researcher can help with defining the tasks, moderating the sessions as well as provide a level of ‘objectivity’ by not being the person who designed or built what is being evaluated. Involving the designer / developer in the sessions enables them to see first hand ‘real’ people interacting with their product, where there are areas for improvement and how they might go about resolving any issues. This approach also does away with any lengthy reporting back. Insights can be observed, taken away and fed back into the design process almost immediately. However, a brief summary with key findings and recommendations can be written up as a more formal record. It is a method that suits the ‘agile framework’ well. Guerrilla testing can be used throughout the service lifecycle. As it is cheap to set up, run and report back on, it is a method that can be used frequently. There are a few logistics that should be taken into consideration before conducting any guerrilla testing; Remember, whenever recording sessions you must seek permission from the participant first. Provide them with a written consent form for them to sign. The key weakness of guerrilla testing as a research method it that is not statistically robust and participants may not always match your ‘target’ audience in terms of skills, expertise, knowledge. This can vary from between 6-12 participants in any given round of guerrilla testing. It is very much dependent on where and when those sessions are conducted. 16 teenagers evaluated the National Citizen Service website. Sessions were conducted in the canteen of a further education college in Nottingham. Usability and editorial findings were discovered and quickly fed back to the development teams. The whole process took 2 days.","description":"Guerrilla user testing is a low cost method of user testing.

To begin with, involve a small cross-functional group of people who will quickly: Make sure the people in your group have: It’s important that you keep good notes from any interviews or deliberation sessions and assess different suppliers equally. One way to do this is to use a scoring matrix. Know that it’s very common to use multiple suppliers. This can be because they offer different but compatible services, or additional redundancy. It can be technically challenging to do this, but can provide extra resilience for larger projects. Suppliers offer a number of different approaches to hosting services, which can make it difficult to compare them. The following information is intended as only a brief introduction of each type, covering: This advice is complicated because many service providers redefine the meanings of hosting terms for marketing reasons, especially: These terms are marketable at the moment and often used incorrectly, so always look into the details of the services being offered. If you have a large project with very specific requirements, you may decide that purchasing hardware and even running a dedicated data centre is suitable. The costs and timescales involved here are very high and in most cases it’s unlikely to be your best option. Many providers offer co-location services – you purchase your own hardware and rent space in a managed data centre.  This provides a great deal of flexibility, but can introduce lead times and other physical constraints. It also requires a wide range of technical specialist skills. Lots of service providers have a shared or managed hosting option. This tends to mean renting specific virtual or physical machines for fixed periods of time. Different suppliers offer different management services; some just manage the underlying machine while others will support the operating system and even specific applications running on the machines. In the last several years this has become a common approach to managing hosting and infrastructure requirements. It tends to involve a capability to rapidly add or remove capacity, often in minutes, and to be billed only for what is used. This provides a great deal of flexibility and the ability to keep costs down, but also requires a degree of technical skill to manage well. Similar to infrastructure as a service, platform as a service offerings tend to allow for quickly adding or removing capacity and precise ‘pay on demand’ pricing. The difference is that you are considered completely separate from the underlying infrastructure. The unit here is the running application, not a virtual or physical machine. Using a platform as a service places a number of restrictions on the software architecture, but can move the support burden for parts of the stack onto the supplier. Before making a decision about your hosting supplier, weigh up a wide range of different factors, including: Unfortunately this is a technical field with many options. Seemingly similar services can have wildly different structures or different cost models that can result in large differences in your total cost of ownership (cost of the project).  It’s important to involve technical colleagues or trusted third parties in any discussions and/or decisions.","description":"You need servers to run your software.

This lets them collaborate effectively with each other and shows the status of their work to anyone who looks at the wall. This is called ‘visual management’.  Visiting teams and seeing their walls for yourself is an essential governance activity. A good wall conveys the information you need to support a team in a simple, clear manner. It also supports effective decision-making.  If a wall can’t be easily understood (eg it’s not immediately clear where the team is blocked), it’s up to the team’s delivery manager to make improvements. Different teams need to use different information to manage their work, so walls will differ from team to team. However, most walls are used to manage what: Work to do is represented as cards that are moved along the wall. Sometimes cards are annotated, eg to show who’s working on them or that the work is blocked.  Team walls capture the flow of work through different stages. The team should also track: Information about the service and team is also commonly shown, like:  This wall is used to manage a software team’s work. It shows their goals, successes and a simple flow of tasks: to do - in progress - in review - to deploy - done. The coloured stickers are used to show who’s working on each task. Teams can also use walls to manage complicated tasks:  This is a section of the wall used to manage the transfer of departments and agency websites to GOV.UK. It uses a similar flow of tasks but on a much larger scale. Using physical walls like these creates a focus for the team and promotes transparency - anyone walking past can have a look.  Sometimes it’s useful to use an online tool as well as the wall - eg to track delivery history or manage a large backlog. For example, a major, heavily-used service may have hundreds of fault tickets or non-urgent suggestions for change that are best tracked electronically.

Why do we do this? There are service providers on GCloud who will provide DNS Hosting with a web-interface for you to manage your DNS records. Many infrastructure hosting providers also provide DNS services for the use of their customers. As a last resort (or for larger services) you may wish to ask the supplier to provide DNS services by any means they consider reasonable (including utilising options 1 and 2 above). Once a domain name for a service has been agreed, the GDS Infrastructure Team allocates service.gov.uk domain names by delegating control to the team running the service. The team should provide the details of nameservers and GDS will delegate {service-name}.service.gov.uk to those nameservers. At that point the service team will be able to manage the detailed configuration of which servers the domain name points to, and so on. The domain direct.gov.uk was managed by the DirectGov Service Desk directly (and inherited by GDS). All domains were administered by DirectGov and each subdomain did not have its own DNS servers. This meant that services would need to give details of the names and IP addresses of their webservers to DirectGov, who would directly create the necessary A and CNAME records. The DirectGov Service Desk were also a critical part of any DNS change. The new model for service.gov.uk domains requires that you provide your own DNS servers which can respond to requests for {something}.{servicename}.service.gov.uk. It is not necessary that you run and manage your own separate DNS servers: It is likely that as you build and iterate your service you will need to make a number of changes to its configuration. You might introduce load balancers or content delivery networks, you may move hosting providers, or your provider might need to change the IP addresses that your servers are assigned. In any of those cases it is important that your team is able to quickly respond to the situation and make any relevant changes with as few intermediaries as possible. By delegating control GDS ensures that control is in the hands of the service team and not blocked by a central authority.","description":"Once a domain name for a service has been agreed, the\nGDS Infrastructure Team allocates service.gov.uk domain names by delegating control to the team running\nthe service.

This is an explanation of some of our guidance and the reasons behind the rules. Users only really read 20 to 28% of a web page. Where users just want to complete a service as quickly as possible, there’s added user impatience so you may find users skim words even more. The content design guidance, style guide and design patterns give guidance on how to write. This page details why we do it. All of this guidance is based on the learning skills of an average person in the UK, who has English as a first language. You don’t read one word at a time. You bounce around. You anticipate words and fill them in. By the time you’re 9 years old, your brain can drop up to 30% of the text and still understand. Your vocabulary will grow but this reading skill stays with you as an adult. You should also be confident in sounding out words and blending sounds. You may not know the word, but you have the skills to be able to learn it. This is why we talk about the reading age being around 9 years old. When you learn to read, you start with a mix of upper and lower case but you don’t start understanding upper case until you’re around 6 years old. At first, you may sound out letters, merge sounds, merge letters, learn the word. Then you stop reading it. At that point, you recognise the shape of the word. This speeds up comprehension and speed of reading. So we don’t want people to read. We want people to recognise the ‘shape’ of the word and understand. It’s a lot faster. Capital letters are reputed to be 13 to 18% harder for users to read. So we try to avoid them. Also, in modern usage it sounds like we’re shouting. We are government. We should not be shouting. By the time you are 9, you’re building up your ‘common words’. Your primary set is around 5,000 words in your vocabulary; your secondary set is around 10,000 words. These are words you use every day. They include a lot of plain English words, which is why we should be obsessed with them. These are words so easy to comprehend, you learn to read them quickly and then you stop reading and start recognising. We explain all unusual terms on GOV.UK. This is because you can understand 6-letter words as easily as 2-letter words – if they’re in context. Sometimes, you can read a short word faster than a single letter – if the context is correct. Not only are we giving users full information, we’re speeding up their reading time. By giving full context and using common words, we’re allowing them to understand in the fastest possible way. In tools and transactions you need to give people context. By giving them information they’re expecting, you help them get through it faster. We should remember that people with some learning disabilities read letter for letter. They don’t bounce around like other users. They also can’t fully understand a sentence if it’s too long. People with moderate learning disabilities can understand sentences of 5 to 8 words without difficulty. By concentrating on common words we can help all users understand sentences of around 25 words. Our audience is potentially anyone living in the UK. We need to be able to communicate in a way that most users understand. Government can’t afford to be elitist and use language only specialists can understand. We need to open up our information and services to everyone. That means using common words and working with natural reading behaviour.

It’s very important that this information can’t be intercepted by malicious third parties as it travels over the Internet. Therefore, all services accessed through service.gov.uk domains (including APIs) MUST only be accessible through secure connections. For web-based services this means HTTPS only (often referred to by the acronyms TLS or SSL, which both refer to the protocol underpinning these secure connections). Services MUST NOT accept HTTP connections under any circumstances. Strict Transport Security or HSTS is an extension to the HTTPS protocol that tells web browsers that they should make extra efforts to verify the security of a connection: they should assume for a specified period that all connections with this server should be via HTTPS and shouldn’t accept mixed content (where some content on a page is served via HTTPS and some via HTTP). This provides an extra level of assurance about the integrity of the connection. Once a service manager has verified that their HTTPS setup is working fine they SHOULD enable HSTS on the production domains (www., admin. and assets.), by setting an HTTP response header such as representing a commitment to HTTPS-only traffic for 14 days. Once the service manager is confident that HSTS is configured correctly, you SHOULD increase the commitment to months or years: In order to provide your service over HTTPS you will need to purchase a certificate (or certificates) from a recognised vendor. SSL vendors vary but regardless of which service you choose to use, you’ll need to validate with the vendor that you own the domain. The verification methods that are commonly in use (in order of preference) are: The least preferred method of sending an email to the domain owner relies on the GDS Infrastructure Team seeing the verification email and responding. If this is necessary, then first send an email to the address that you intend to use for verification from your own email address warning that an SSL verification is needed for your service. Your request should be sent to hostmaster@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk, and should mention that an SSL verification email will be sent to them. It also helps if you include the domain name(s) to be secured and the name of the SSL certificate vendor. The infrastructure team are unable to validate requests sent to any @service.gov.uk address.","description":"Many services will collect personal information from users.

It allows us to: It is primarily defined by two activities: This document covers how to go about executing an alpha project. Following this guidance will help you create a successful alpha project. You should bear in mind that these guidelines are flexible and are intended to direct you towards achieving your project goals simply and quickly. Before planning an alpha, the team must work out what the goals of the alpha are. For example, some of your goals might be: The department should communicate their goals in the request for proposals. The team will probably develop their own additional goals as well. The reason for running an alpha is to identify risks to the wider project early. This means it should identify a project’s biggest risks and explore those risks to understand them better. In most government projects, the risks fall into 3 main categories: The design risks cover the issues that come with running a user-centred design process within an iterative model. We find that it often takes several attempts to get the service proposition correct for the citizen. You’ll need to think about things like: The business process risks include: The technical risks tend to be about integrating into the existing systems. For example: In our experience, there are always technical risks to all projects. Most government departments do have a history of solving technical risks and have entire teams dedicated to them. Business process and design risks are far less well understood, and so we encourage alphas to focus on exploring those risks with prototyping over full service integrations. The well-rounded team will need to have various skills, including: The team will probably be bigger than this, and the service may supply its own team members who will normally be learning during this process, and thus probably won’t be contributing significantly. The team will work together in an agile manner, doing iterations of either 1 or 2 weeks. For a short project we’d normally recommend 1 week iterations where possible. The team must have the core skills to: The Business Analyst and Delivery Manager roles are there to ensure that the findings can be fed back into the team and the wider organisation. Each alpha will be different, because the risks and goals are different. But we find that there are common aspects in how good alphas are run. We want to maximise the amount of learning that is happening in the alpha. So we tend to expect alphas to be short, about 8 weeks in length. We expect alphas to normally consist of: We believe that alphas should start with an inception process. An inception is designed to bring the team together and share the knowledge about the risks and goals identified. We tend to recommend a short inception – between 4 to 7 days seems to work well. The inception should be run by the supplier team, probably by the Delivery Manager. It will look at a variety of business, technical and user aspects of the project. Each supplier has a different format for these, but we see fairly common outputs including: The facilitator will of course give up time to various specialists to run individual sessions. The aims include: The inception may well cover introductions to agile itself, if the project team need it, and should also have a demonstration and retrospective at the end of it. Alphas are often about identifying competing hypotheses about the user journey or business process. We expect to produce many prototypes to test the hypothesis, and run tests in a short amount of time so we can learn, change and retest. These feedback loops are crucial. At this early a stage of a project, it is rare to be able to choose a single flow or design. Because of this, we encourage the building and testing of many prototypes. This allows you to quickly get feedback on the best experience for the users and to test competing ideas. We expect that a first draft of a user flow will have issues. You should seek to revisit the design, research and test process on each flow during many iterations. The iterative process we would recommend should be a straight up agile process combined with UX and user research. We would encourage the following format: This structure might move around a bit, but you will want to do the user research early in the iteration to give plenty of time to feed into the next iteration. This enables fast turnaround on the stories. Working at this pace will result in: This assumes fairly high definition prototypes. These may have backend systems that mock out service integrations, but which contain actual working logic. If you need to iterate faster (as is likely at first), you can start with much lower fidelity prototypes (like paper). This can let you test various flows and allow much faster iteration of research and prototype development. We would expect that you will do a demonstration of the service journey so far. This happens at the end of each iteration, and highlights what the team has learnt and what the team is planning on doing next. We’ve often found that aligning the iterations to Monday to Friday is not a best practice. It can cause logistical issues: Starting the iteration on a Wednesday, with User testing on Thursday and demo the following Tuesday has worked well in the past. The value of the alpha process is that the team can use it to identify early the biggest risks to the Beta part of the program. It is important to remember that the most valuable goals from the alpha process are the increased domain understanding and the team forming behaviours. If the code produced during the alpha is not high-enough quality, then it’s fine to throw it away and rebuild. For example, the team may elect not to use test-driven development during this stage. Those activities represent investment in quality. Remember that a primary goal during the alpha is learning. We might not be ready to make the investment in creating production-ready systems. In particular, that investment might be premature if the team learns they are not solving the right problem. Another output of the alpha can be the early decision not to continue into Beta. This represents a successful alpha since it reduces wasted time and money. It may well be the case that at the end of the alpha you go back to the discovery outputs and start a new alpha with a different focus or go back and perform another discovery. However, assuming a successful alpha project, then early in the alpha process, the Delivery Manager and the Service Manager will start to work on the business proposal for the Beta program. The reason for starting so early on the Beta program proposal is that often the team would like to continue without a break into the beta program to maintain the momentum and so need to allow for the time to gain approval for further spending The last demo of the alpha should have the attendance of the project board or senior management team from the service. At that demo, you are able to show what the alpha has achieved and show the feasibility of the beta program. Assuming that the status reports to project board and the show and tell have got approval, then as the project draws to an end, the team will want to have a final retrospective, and produce a backlog of epic stories for the Beta program.","description":"An alpha is a process that happens at the beginning of a project.

implementing this approach will require the cooperation of your department’s information assurance team, so it’s important to engage them early identifying legal requirements which disrupt digital delivery and hinder digital take-up (eg data sharing restrictions, requirements for wet signatures) and develop a plan to resolve them discussing these with your policy team to work out non-bureaucratic solutions In this case study (PDF, 99KB), the DVLA explain how they overcame legislative, bureaucratic and data protection barriers preventing take-up of their Electronic Vehicle Licensing Service and the lessons learnt. setting out in plain English the steps you have taken to protect your users from fraud and inappropriate data sharing educating users about how your services and procedures should work so that your users are less susceptible to phishing activities and third parties which mis-sell government services making sure that your department’s single point of contact (SPOC  – see below for details) is aware of your service and has put in place measures to support users’ reports of mis-selling or phishing: every department with public-facing transactions should have a SPOC that co-ordinates the investigation and resolution of end-users’ reports about scams or phishing activity monitoring usage of digital transaction to identify where in the end-to-end user journey customers are dropping out, and using your customer research to understand why they’re failing to finish the digital transactions limiting the need for your users to revert to non-digital channels (eg phone or face-to-face) to do things like checking the progress of their application checking, for example, that your digital service acknowledges successfully completed applications and allows progress to be tracked online getting access to usage level data, so you can make useful comparisons against a task carried out in 2 different ways, eg number of registration requests completed via offline channels as well as via your digital service determining cost per transaction, by channel – combining the cost per transaction for all your offline channels makes it harder to understand how usage is changing and its cost implications for your service setting the right metrics for measuring digital take-up measuring the number of complaints or requests for support that your digital service is generating eg calls to your call centre agreeing the methodology for measuring savings due to channel shift – try as much as possible to select tangible metrics and minimise the use of estimates This case study (PDF, 94KB)  from Hertfordshire County Council about their Library Renewals Service explains how they developed a channel shift tracker tool to track and measure channel shift; and how its monthly dashboard informs strategic management decisions. getting sufficient demographic information about your user base, so you can set ambitious and achievable targets for channel shift – the Digital Landscape Research sets out useful information on internet usage levels by demographic considering projected savings from digital service provision and using these as a guide for setting your targets; it’s likely that you’ll have to prioritise increasing digital take-up for some of your digital services over others (both existing and new or recently redesigned) to maximise savings have unstructured routes into your service (eg email – online forms are much better) make other channels easier (eg pre-populating paper forms but not online ones) request unnecessary information unquestioningly maintain service standards for traditional channels; review them once your digital service is up and running enter into outsourcing contracts which discourage providers from promoting channel shift (eg paying per call handled) It’s essential to increase the take-up of government digital services so more users can benefit from improved government services. Increased take-up will also make it possible for assisted digital support to be focused on those who are unable to use the digital service. Digital take-up is one of the four key performance indicators your service will need to benchmark, measure and monitor in order to meet the Digital by Default Service Standard. Digital Landscape Research found in 2012 that 82% of the population are online and over 60% of people have used online banking, yet the take-up of most government digital services was well below those figures. 10 steps have proven to be successful in ‘shifting’ people away from non-digital channels, eg over-the-counter services and telephone helplines, to using digital services. These steps will help you identify and fix some of the barriers to take-up of your digital service, including: usability, legal barriers, security fears, lack of trust and awareness of your service among users. These 10 steps will generate a higher take-up of digital services. We’ve included case studies which outline the experiences of several organisations that have implemented these steps, the impact this has had on their services and the lessons they’ve learned. Use this information as a step-by-step guide for increasing your digital take-up. Every action is important and should be considered and seriously attempted. Hertfordshire County Council, as explained in this case study (PDF, 94KB), developed an understanding of how and why people use its Online Free School Meals service, and used this knowledge to increase take-up. Another case study from Hertfordshire County Council (PDF, 93KB) looks at some of the steps they took to get users to try its Online Schools Admissions service for the first time. While this case study from Chelmsford City Council (PDF, 74KB) shows how a simple how to guide sent out with the usual service renewal letter switched 40% of service renewals to the online service. In this case study (PDF, 103KB), the Driving Standards Agency (DSA) explains some of the steps it took to communicate the benefits of its Driving Test Booking Service to its service users. It also highlights some of the lessons it learned along the way. In this case study from Chelmsford City Council (PDF, 81KB), the critical factor is the timing of the communications. The important aspect is ensuring that communications get to the right people at the right time, so that they are encouraged to use the online service. This case study (PDF, 103KB), about the Land Registry and their e-Document Registration Service highlights the value of involving other stakeholders to help to communicate the benefits of using digital services. This case study (PDF, 150KB) about the HMRC Cross Tax Strategy outlines the ways they work with staff and partner organisations to encourage the use of their digital channels. This case study (PDF, 145KB)  from the HMRC Cross Tax Strategy explains how HMRC offered financial incentives for online filing and why they later switched to non-fiscal benefits. In this case study (PDF, 131KB), from Companies House, customer insight is used to ensure that the online service fully meets customer needs and to develop a communications strategy highlighting the benefits of online filing (including fee differentials) for service users. This case study (PDF, 76KB), about the Land Registry e-Document Registration Service shows how they took action to reassure service users that the digital service met current standards to address potential security risks. Your digital take-up will not be as successful if you: You need those who can use digital services to do so as soon as possible. It will cut costs and improve assisted digital support. The Government Digital Strategy requires departments to review their channel shift plans every year.","description":"It’s essential to increase the take-up of government digital services so more users can benefit from improved government services.

It’s made up of two things; Building good services means meeting the needs of users. 82% of the UK population is online. They have high expectations for what makes a good digital service, whether it’s from a bank, a travel agent, a retailer or a broadcaster, and when services don’t meet those standards they let the people responsible know. Government needs to learn from teams who are building successful, world class services. It needs to place users at the heart of service design, incorporating their feedback at every step of the way. Typically, government services are built after long, costly procurement processes.  In this way of working, users are seldom – if ever – consulted about the service they’ll be using. The first time the public might see a service is when it goes live, by which time it’s too late to make any changes when it turns out to be unfit for purpose. This way of working tends to encourage the creation of overly prescriptive policy, which then forms the basis of the requirements document. Instead, teams need to constantly iterate against user feedback.  This means building and testing in small chunks, working quickly to deliver improvements to a service. Teams will work out how to best meet the needs of users, releasing code regularly and working in an agile way. This new approach allows closer working between policy and delivery teams and as a result, the development of more responsive policy, two aims of the Civil Service Reform plan. The GDS Design Principles present a clear vision of how delivery teams can think about designing digital by default services. These should be a touchstone for every member of a delivery team. The Government Digital Strategy sets out the context we are working in. The departmental responses to the strategy contain a detailed breakdown of which services in particular will be tackled first. The progress of the services is also published on GOV.UK. And the Digital by Default Service Standard lists the criteria against which all new and redesigned services will be judged from April 2014. Find out which services must meet the standard. Another good way of finding out what’s going on in the government around digital is through the SPRINT initiative, organised by the Cabinet Office. At SPRINT13, Minister for the Cabinet Office Francis Maude discussed the current landscape of digital within government. Watch that video below. SPRINT 13 also saw a talk by Stephen Kelly in which he paints a picture of what service redesign could mean for users. When you’re confident about the basics of service design and the requirement of the standard, you can start exploring the advice and guidance in the manual. You can explore the manual by phase of delivery, specific roles, or by topic.","description":"The service manual is here to help service managers and digital delivery teams across government make services so good that people prefer to use them.

Note that if an intermediary is the intended end user (rather than completing the service on behalf of the end user), you may need to provide assisted digital support. assisted digital support is delivered within legal and policy constraints, such as the Equality Act 2010 assisted digital users are not charged more to use your service than those who do not need any help your assisted digital support provides free translation and accessibility facilities, to meet relevant legal requirements if the user enters the information, they are responsible if a support provider enters the information, they are responsible for making sure that the information is correct, even if the user can see the screen the cost of travelling to an office calling a contact centre paying for printing, scanning and taking photos Your service will need to pass point 10 of the Digital by Default Service Standard, which is to “Put appropriate assisted digital support in place that’s aimed towards those who genuinely need it”. Here you will be able to find out: Assisted digital is support for people who can’t use online government services on their own. The support can be someone guiding a user through the digital service or entering a user’s information into the digital service on their behalf. It can be provided by the private, voluntary or public sectors.  Assisted digital support must include advice on how to use the digital service. This could be information already on GOV.UK (or on an alternative domain for departments that are exempt from GOV.UK) about the service or the policy decisions behind it. The person giving assisted digital support must only need to use information already available to do their job. Good assisted digital support: Find out how to create an assisted digital action plan. GDS’s Digital Landscape Research (2012) found that 18% of UK adults are offline. This means that about 9m people never or rarely use the internet. Go ON UK estimates that 1 in 5, or 11m, adults lack Basic Online Skills (including people who are offline). And Lloyds Bank UK Business Digital Index 2014 found that 1 in 3 SMEs and charities also lack basic online skills. Assisted digital support needs to be available to service users in the UK or UK citizens who are living overseas who cannot access or complete a user journey on their own, such as: Every service will have a different proportion of users who need assisted digital support. You will need to carry out user research to understand your users, including those with very low or no digital skills. Your service doesn’t need to provide assisted digital support if: As a service manager, you will need to make sure that: You may provide users with non-financial incentives for completing the service digitally, such as later deadlines for online self assessment tax returns. Assisted digital support providers are responsible for making sure that the user has a basic understanding of your service. Responsibility for  the accuracy of information (eg typing a passport number or date of birth) lies with either the service provider or the service user, depending on who is entering the information: Assisted digital support providers can choose not to provide support if it can’t be done accurately, eg because of a bad phone line or if the user has a speech impairment. In such instances, the assisted digital support provider must guide the user to an appropriate alternative. Sometimes an assisted digital user may need to pay for the costs of accessing assisted digital support like: These costs must be in line with existing policy, eg not using higher-rate phone lines. You can only provide assisted digital support in person, through web chat or over the telephone, and not on paper. This is because a user’s information will be fed directly into the digital service by the person or technology they are interacting with. This reduces administrative overheads related to double handling and re-typing. You can offer assisted digital support at the support provider’s location (eg high street or office location) or as an outreach visit (eg at the user’s home or in hospital). The user sits alongside the assisted digital support provider and can see the digital service on the screen. It’s important to take this approach because it enables the user to learn digital skills and build confidence. This means the user is more likely to complete the digital service on their own in the future. For the same reason, it’s preferable for users to type in their own information. Providers of in person assisted digital support may need to type the user’s information into the service if a user cannot do so themselves. The preferred approach to telephone support is for the assisted digital support provider to talk to the user at the same time they are trying to use your service. This will encourage the user to build their digital skills and confidence, making it more likely that they will be able to do it on their own in future. Alternatively, telephone support may involve the user providing information to the assisted digital support provider to type into the digital service on their behalf. Assisted digital support may be provided on screen while the user is attempting to use the digital service independently. An on-screen dialogue enables the assisted digital support provider to support the user. When procuring for assisted digital services, departments should use the Front Office Counter Services (FOCS) framework where this provides value for money and meets user need. Where departments choose to use an alternative contractual mechanism, they should consult and agree with HM Treasury (including reasons for selecting an alternative contractual mechanism) before submitting their spend request to Cabinet Office. The Efficiency Reform Group (ERG) should seek relevant HM Treasury spending team approval on any decision not to use the FOCS framework.  Some people can use digital services but for a range of reasons prefer other channels. Digital take-up is about encouraging them to start using digital government services instead. Assisted digital is about supporting people who can’t use government digital services on their own. Helping individuals to develop the basic digital skills needed to make the most of being online more broadly is called Digital inclusion. Assisted digital and digital inclusion both involve users who can’t use digital services on their own. Both approaches help users gain the confidence and skills to be able to use the service on their own in the future. Any user that builds their digital skills and confidence to the point that they no longer require assisted digital support should then be included in your digital take-up strategy. Some users may never develop the skills or confidence to be able to complete digital services independently and will always need assisted digital support. Unlike assisted digital and digital inclusion users, digital take-up users can use online services, but prefer to use other channels for a number of reasons. Service managers must find ways of encouraging their service’s users to user digital channels whenever possible. If your service includes GOV.UK Verify (enabling users to authenticate their identity before using online services), you must ensure that assisted digital support is available for the full end-to-end transaction, including the identity providers’ pages.

Needs Analysis – identify the service’s GOV.UK Verify requirements (levels and types), users and dependencies. Agree a provisional date for connection to hub. Planning – complete a readiness assessment. Agree a detailed plan setting out what the service and GDS will each do and when. Get internal approvals within GDS and the relying party’s organisation. Connect to hub – agree a memorandum of understanding between the GOV.UK Verify Programme and the department responsible for the service. Users of digital government services need to be able to sign in securely and conveniently to access services and records, and be confident that their data is secure and their privacy protected. GOV.UK Verify is the way that users of digital services can sign in securely to digital services, and digital services can be confident that users are who they say they are. A good background description can be found on this blog post. Service providers can be assured they’re providing their service to the right individual or business after matching an assured identity to their own records. This guidance is for government digital service providers that need to use the GOV.UK Verify service. Service providers are referred to as ‘relying parties’ to avoid confusion between those providing the government service to the user and those providing the identity service to the user. The guidance gives an overview of the GOV.UK Verify service and explains what relying parties will need to do to prepare to start using the GOV.UK Verify service. Relying parties that need to use the GOV.UK Verify service will need to: When users try to use a service provided by a relying party, they will be directed to the GOV.UK Verify hub at the point in the user journey where the relying party needs to know who they are. The hub manages communications between users, relying parties and identity providers. It makes sure that users can assert their identities securely and safely, and that relying parties can be confident that users are who they say they are. Users will be guided through selecting an identity provider from a list of organisations contracted by the Cabinet Office to provide the service. Identity providers are private sector organisations that are certified as meeting relevant security and service standards. They carry out checks to confirm the user’s identity, using methods designed to meet published standards, and then communicate that identity to the relevant government department through the hub. The user returns to the hub once this is complete so they can be matched up to the right record in the relying party using a limited set of information that has been verified by the identity provider: The relying parties use this limited set of identity information (the matching dataset) to make sure they’re dealing with the right person. This is known as matching. This involves looking for the correct record in the relying party’s database which matches the assured identity provided by the user. The hub sends the matching dataset to the relying party’s matching service. Relying parties are responsible for: Once matching has taken place, the user is directed to the correct record within the relying party’s service. The GOV.UK Verify team can advise services on how to develop their matching service. Once a user has registered with an identity provider, they will be able to sign in to all digital services that use the GOV.UK Verify service and require the same level of assurance, using credentials provided to them by their identity provider. The first government services to start using the GOV.UK Verify service will connect to the hub in early 2014. Each other service will connect at a time agreed with the programme team. Relying parties that have GOV.UK Verify requirements should contact the GOV.UK Verify programme team to start planning their connection to the service. Read the blog posts from the GOV.UK Verify programme team for more information and updates about the development of the identity assurance service, Relying parties can assess their GOV.UK Verify needs by using guidance published by the Cabinet Office. Each relying party must carry out a risk assessment of their digital service, using Good Practice Guide 43: Requirements for secure delivery of online public services. The identity’s ‘level of assurance’ is the degree of confidence the relying party requires that a user is who they say they are: The different levels of assurance available and how they are reached are defined by the Cabinet Office’s good practice guides. Each relying party must determine the level of assurance required for each digital service: Each relying party will need to go through the programme’s induction process. This process consists of 4 structured stages: Government providers of digital services that want to find out more about GOV.UK Verify, with a view to becoming relying parties, should contact Janet Hughes. Each relying party will need to set up a matching service that can accept digital assertions of identity and match them to their internally held records. This process makes sure they can use the identity assertions provided by the GOV.UK Verify service. Matching assured identities to the records held by relying parties is likely to be complicated – each relying party will need to establish the most efficient and effective way of doing this depending on the quality of its data and how it’s stored and managed. Relying parties will need to be able to do a risk-based match to ascertain which locally held account to match against. For example, relying parties need to be able to handle users who have proved their identities, but the service can’t match with sufficient confidence to any particular record or even multiple records. GDS has developed a matching service adapter that will help some relying parties to convert their communication with the hub to the appropriate language. The service provider will be supplied with details of the matching service adapter during the early stages of the induction process.","description":"Users of digital government services need to be able to sign in securely and conveniently to access services and records, and be confident that their data is secure and their privacy protected.","link":"/service-manual/identity-assurance/index.html"},{"_type":"manual_section","organisations":["government-digital-service"],"manual":"service-manual","title":"Government Service Design Manual: The team","indexable_content":"Learning and development Recruitment Building a digital delivery team Your working environment The team Working with delivery teams outside of government analyse user needs, and turn these into user stories manage the scope and prioritisation of stories manage and report to stakeholders managing dependencies on other teams where needed, procure services or solutions from 3rd parties design, build, test, demo and iterate software solutions (the ‘making’!) test solutions on real users deploy and host the software find solutions for accrediting and handling of data supporting the live running of the service (monitoring, fixing things when they break, responding to users) a service manager (the ‘product owner’)            probably supported by a product manager       supported by one or more digital performance analysts         probably supported by a product manager supported by one or more digital performance analysts a delivery manager a tech lead one or more designers one or more user researchers one or more developers one or more content designers the support of a technical architect the support of some web ops expertise The right team needs to be in place to deliver a digital by default service. Teams are multidisciplinary, meet regularly, and often work close together to deliver rapid iterations of user-centred products. They combine designers, developers, researchers and content specialists to deliver a project, and may expand or contract in size as services are developed. The exact shape of the team will vary across departments, and depend on various factors including the number and scale of any transactional services the department is redesigning and running, and the extent to which each will be delivered in house. Whether new recruits or experienced civil servants, all team members need a shared base of specialist skills and knowledge. GDS offers 3 highly practical specialist learning and development programmes. Many of the skills needed to lead and deliver digital public services are relatively new to government and are highly sought after. GDS has pulled together a set of materials to help departments with the recruitment of technology leaders and digital specialists. There are a range of skills and capabilities that need to come together to successfully deliver a digital service. The focus is likely to shift as you move through the different phases of development – from discovery, through alphas and betas, preparing for launch, and then running and iteratively improving the live service. The core team is likely to remain fairly constant, but may need to draw in additional resource and expertise along the way. Regardless of the delivery approach, all transactional services need to have a service manager. The service manager is likely to need support from a core team focused on analysing user data, identifying user needs, writing user stories, reporting and other aspects of stakeholder management and governance. Alongside the service manager at the heart of any digital delivery team will be the ‘makers’ – the designers, developers, technical architects and others who design, build, test and deploy the software and content that meet the needs of your users. Supporting and enabling this ‘making’ are others who make sure the user needs are well understood, clearly articulated and prioritised, that stakeholders are kept informed, that releases are well communicated, that users of the service are supported, that performance is monitored etc. A core digital delivery team needs to be able to: There is no hard and fast rule on the roles or team structure needed to fulfil these functions, but a core team will probably consist of: The team will also have a shared understanding of the accessibility needs and possible assisted digital needs of a service’s users. If some elements are going to be delivered by 3rd parties (eg software, hosting or operational support) then it will be important to have ‘intelligent buyers’ in the team. These people will know how to go about selecting and procuring specialists, and what to do to make sure their introduction to the team is as smooth as possible. Whiteboard, wall space and proximity can make a big impact on the effectiveness of a team. A service manager can do lots of things to create a good environment for the team.

Four days to equip service managers with the basic knowledge, network and confidence to take the lead in transforming digital services. This programme is designed specifically for newly appointed service managers who complete the programme in cohorts drawn from across government departments and agencies. The foundation day is a one-day workshop covering the main points of digital in government for people directly involved in delivering services. Participants may be in specialist digital roles, such as product manager, business analyst, designer or developer, or in other roles that are expected to work closely with digital teams. It is not recommended for newly appointed service managers, who should book to attend the service manager induction programme instead. Three days of more specialised modules to help you succeed and improve in particular areas of the Digital by Default Service Standard. Unless already very familiar with digital in government, participants should complete the foundation day or service manager induction before taking part in the open programme. Newly appointed service managers should attend the induction programme and all three days of the open programme. Others may choose to join any or all of the days as appropriate to their role and development needs.","description":"GDS offers 3 highly practical learning and development programmes so you can strengthen the skills, knowledge and network you will need to succeed in your digital role.","link":"/service-manual/the-team/learning-and-development/index.html"},{"_type":"manual_section","organisations":["government-digital-service"],"manual":"service-manual","title":"Government Service Design Manual: Service design phases","indexable_content":"Discovery Alpha Beta Live Retirement      Discovery      A short phase, in which you start researching the needs of your service’s users, find out what you should be measuring, and explore technological or policy-related constraints.

This way of working can be very different for those used to long specifications and procurement processes, but it’s essential for producing high-quality services to a standard that many users expect.  An agile project is about creating fast iterations of products based on the feedback of real users.  It means regularly releasing small pieces of functionality; constant communication between team members, and using equipment that displays progress being made by your team (eg project management software or whiteboards). Find out more information on: User understanding is the most important factor when creating a service, so you need to have a clear understanding of what users need and make sure those needs are met. You can achieve this by writing user stories.  A user story is generally one or more sentences in length and describes:  These user stories will help your team to produce the required features of your service, and writing them well can make a huge difference to the quality and speed of development. Learn how to write effective user stories. Product development during an agile project is broken into different stages, called sprints.  In a sprint, team members aim to achieve goals within set timeframes. A sprint at GDS generally lasts a week and runs from Wednesday to Tuesday, however other agile development teams may run longer or shorter sprints. Have daily team meetings (stand-ups). Stand-ups are an opportunity for members of your team to discuss:  Learn how to structure sprint cycles and stand-ups. Run retrospectives at the end of each sprint.

More detailed guidance on each of these techniques can be found in the links below. User research can be categorised into 2 broad themes – product research and strategic research. Product research can incorporate both qualitative and quantitative techniques. Qualitative techniques are intensive and often small scale. These include focus groups and one-to-one interviews, and are typically used to explore and analyse unstructured data. Quantitative techniques involve higher-volume research, and include online surveys, face-to-face interviews, and involve a structured approach to data collection and analysis. Product-based research can be conducted in-house or via a specialist agency. In-house approaches can be quicker as they involve less lead time (eg procurement), but require skilled in-house researchers, and can involve the procurement of some specialist software.  Typically agencies are only used when specialist skills/experience is required that is not available in-house, and/or the scale of the project would mean it is difficult to provide dedicated internal resource. Strategic research also uses quantitative and qualitative methods, and is used to help understand the appetite for a product or service – typically looking at the size of the market, trends, type of users etc. Secondary data, also known as desk research, can be used, and involves the analysis of existing research or information sources. Ideally, secondary research should be conducted before embarking on any research project to understand what is already known, and what research is required to fill the knowledge gaps. This can range from published research, news article, or internal research that has been conducted previously. The table below illustrates the typical product lifecycle, showing the stages at which user research should be conducted. This chart can be used as a reference to ensure that user needs are being factored into design at every stage. Typically this will involve some initial fact finding in the early stages to understand the user needs, including who they are, how they currently do things, how they’d like to do them, and what information is currently available. Each service/product will have a different proportion of users who are not online and this will need to be considered when formulating an appropriate research approach for assisted digital users. The services/product will need to consider the digital skills of their users to understand which users who currently don’t use digital channels: Some services, eg where users are large corporations, will not require assisted digital. The Digital Landscape Research contains a demographic breakdown of who is offline and online and service teams and these techniques may be useful for doing user research.","description":"This guidance provides a broad overview of the methods and techniques available to conduct user research.

Information security is a topic both broad and deep, drawing from fields ranging from economics and psychology through to mathematics and probability. This document doesn’t provide a thorough review of the field. Instead, it aims to: The term information security refers to the theory and practice of defending data or information systems against: There are 3 main concepts that security professionals frequently refer to: In government, much is made of these 3 main “concepts of information security,” as will be explained below. Security systems typically attempt to address one or more of these concerns through: Not every system requires a full range of security controls. ‘Completely secure systems’ don’t exist, and overly secure systems are often too expensive or thoroughly inconvenient for their users. Aim to build a service that is appropriately secure, which you can achieve by managing risks. In practice, you’ll be guided by an assessment of the risks related to a lapse in the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of your service. Government has a fixed set of assurance and accreditation processes. These provide a structure and a shared vocabulary for discussing, analysing and addressing security considerations. If the processes work correctly: The difference between assurance and accreditation processes is that: The important thing to note about building trustworthy and secure systems is that it’s a team game. Involve some level of assurance in your project, no matter how small. This may be as simple as documenting the limited risks and proposing to the Senior Information Risk Owner (SIRO) that the project doesn’t require a formal accreditation. An accreditation stage will be required for anything involving sensitive data or of interest to lots of people. This process is likely to include representatives from all of the above groups. Don’t make assurance and accreditation a completely separate strand of work, or see it as a hurdle to be jumped over (or sidestepped). You’ll only end up with the best product by dealing with risk and making decisions based on a range of expert opinion. The following content will introduce you to assurance and accreditation in government and will use quite a lot of acronyms. Unfortunately these are in common usage and it’s very hard to work with the existing documentation and processes without speaking the lingo. It’s included here in the hope that they’ll provide a helpful reference that can be used when reading existing documentation. It’s important to understand the different roles involved with the assurance and accreditation processes. Each role requires formal training and specialist skills, so decide who plays each of these roles from the very beginning: A SIRO will generally be a senior member of the lead organisation that’s providing the service and is responsible for: More hands on than the SIRO, the accreditor or accreditors will work with the project team to help with: The IAO will be a senior individual involved in running the relevant business. Their role is to understand what information is held, what is added and what is removed, how information is moved, and who has access and why. As a result they are able to understand and address risks to the information. CESG are the government agency responsible for Information Security. They can provide technical assistance or consultation on project issues. CLAS consultants are part of the formal accreditation process and responsible for a lot of the formal documentation. Business impact levels, often shortened to impact levels (IL) are a set of numbers used to guide discussions about risk in government projects. Specifically they are numbers between 0 and 6 for each of the 3 main concepts mentioned above, and measure: More details about identifying these numbers can be found in this extract from HMG IA Standard No. 1. The role holders listed above will work with the wider team to raise the appropriate concerns in the process of designing the service. Your team as a whole will need to make a range of decisions about topics like: It’s essential to have a close working relationship so you can make sure that: The Good Practice Guides (GPG) are documents published by CESG on specific topics of interest to various types of projects. These can act as a good starting point when looking to identify risks and put in place mitigations. Unfortunately many of these documents are Restricted. Set up a working relationship with CESG early on in your project to make sure you can access these documents. Examples include: The Risk Management Document Set or RMADS is the result of your formal accreditation work. It’s likely to be a large set of documents presented to the SIRO for sign-off as part of go-live conversations, including: The IT Health Check (ITHC) forms part of the formal Accreditation. In essence it’s a penetration test carried out by a CESG approved supplier (specifically a CHECK certified individual). Read guidance on penetration and vulnerability testing for more details. Assurance and accreditation work is not just about getting a project to launch, but also covers the running of the resulting service. Over time, new threats may emerge, systems and processes may change, and assumptions may become invalid. Keep your documentation up to date and carry out additional penetration tests on a regular or as-needed basis. Start understanding risks and get involved with the assurance and accreditation process as early on in your project as possible. This checklist is a good starting place for adding milestones to your project plan: It’s important to understand that the assurance and accreditation processes and tools are all about managing the risk associated with the running service. Security is part of this, but just one part. Nearly everything will contain risks: Understand those risks and put in place sensible and suitable mitigations. It’s unrealistic in most cases to aim for a system with no risks, and ignoring them is a recipe for future failure. Aim for a system where the risks are known, and have your team work with risk professionals to make careful decisions about how to deal with them.","description":"When building your service, you’ll need to make sure that appropriate steps are\ntaken to guarantee its security.","link":"/service-manual/making-software/information-security.html"},{"_type":"manual_section","organisations":["government-digital-service"],"manual":"service-manual","title":"Government Service Design Manual: Introduction to governance for service delivery","indexable_content":"What governance is and why we need it Who’s involved in governance Governance principles How to govern      making sure we’re doing things that meet user needs and achieve organisational goals         being aligned to organisational standards and ways of working         deciding what to deliver when and prioritising things         anticipating problems and making decisions to avoid slowing down delivery         multiple teams         broader programmes of work         team level activities         Don’t slow down delivery         Decisions when they’re needed, at the right level         Do it with the right people         Go see for yourself         Only do it if it adds value         Trust and verify         managing approvals and funding your digital service         supporting delivery and managing assurance         supporting your team         how to scale up    Governance enables service delivery by creating the right conditions to ensure that delivery teams can do the right things for users – in the right way and at the right time.

It provides advice on the governance practices needed across: multiple teams broader programmes of work team level activities Delivery teams need support from people who govern so they can build services that meet user needs. Everyone who’s working to deliver a service is in some way responsible for and involved in its governance.

They help make sure that the right things are done in the right way at the right time.

These people who govern are responsible for creating the right conditions for a service to be successful.

From a traditional perspective, user testing measures how well participants respond in the key areas of: This approach is combined with more ‘qualitative’ techniques to help understand the users’ motivations and attitudes as well. A product or service is usually assessed by asking small samples of the target audience to complete specific but realistic tasks in one to one sessions. The facilitator observes how well the participants are able to complete those tasks, noting down the areas or features that cause the participant problems. Often the facilitator will ask participants to think aloud whilst completing those tasks in order to understand their decision processes better. User testing can be conducted on low-fi assets (eg paper prototypes, wireframes) and hi-fi assets, including working prototypes and live digital services. It’s most effective when conducted early within the lifecycle of a product but can be conducted towards the end of the service lifecycle to validate any usability improvements. A lab environment can provide a more formal setting for conducting sessions, with most spaces offering viewing facilities enabling stakeholders and key team members to watch the sessions in real time. Usability testing is best suited to finding the big issues, essentially the problems that affect users trying to perform tasks. However, it is qualitative in nature and is not statistically robust due to the small participant numbers, per round. The lab environment may also be considered a weakness. It means testing is conducted in a very different space to that a user will commonly be in. This method is not an appropriate for understanding user behaviour or user needs eg what they might want from a product or service. Between 5-8 participants, per round of user testing is sufficient to highlight the majority of usability issues. The key is to test often.","description":"User testing is a ‘qualitative’ research method, used to gauge how easy and intuitive a (product, service, website) is to use and whether it supports the needs of its intended audience.","link":"/service-manual/user-centred-design/user-research/lab-based-user-testing.html"},{"_type":"manual_section","organisations":["government-digital-service"],"manual":"service-manual","title":"Government Service Design Manual: Live phase","indexable_content":"Going live Post-launch stages Team requirements monitor system performance optimise the code ensure the service remains secure Final phase: retirement Previous phase: beta You’ve been building a service to meet users needs, and after your public beta you have a tested solution that is ready to release.

This means you need to do: Capacity planning is the process of determining what amount of infrastructure and software is required to run a live system. You also need to look at how this changes over time: This planning will help with both estimating your ongoing costs as well as setting up realistic load and performance tests. Several companies offer products and services around load testing. In many cases it’s useful for you to work with these companies, especially for final testing or the testing of finished components. Still, make sure you also have the capability within your development team to do more specific load and performance testing. Having this makes it possible to have a rapid iterative development style. Without it, your system can have scalability or performance issues that will only be caught later on – when they are much harder to fix. To make sure your system is efficient and able to deal with high levels or traffic, carry out: Although related and tested in similar ways, load testing and performance testing are done for different reasons. It’s useful for you to understand the subtle differences. Make sure you consider both types when testing and analysing results. This is when a site or application is given the most it can handle, while still being able to function properly. GDS test sites and applications under realistic load (traffic) to make sure that sites and applications work for the people using them. Load testing should involve testing load in excess of your expected traffic levels. Do this so you can simulate certain types of Denial of Service (DOS) attack, including a Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) attack. This is about testing stability and responsiveness.

Your ability to act quickly and constructively on user feedback depends on how well you can arrange enquiries for analysis. How you choose to put enquiries into relevant subgroups will depend on: These factors will decide if the process of arranging enquiries will be carried out manually (staff create the metadata for the enquiries they handle) or be automated (the software you use for handling enquiries will add most of the metadata automatically). At the very least, arrange enquiries by: In addition to the very basic channel and target arrangements mentioned above, the following categories may be suitable. Is the enquiry a: Given user privacy concerns, spend time thinking about how you’ll collect data on your users. At the very least, gather minimal information on who is requesting assistance.

You’ll want to have information on: The ultimate reason for contacting helpdesk, eg: As with most of these, tailor these categories based on the specifics of your product and support model. Now that you’ve gathered your data, you need to decide how to share it. Sharing data is easier if all the data can be handled and used directly within your organisation. However, it’s likely that different teams will act on different types of problems, and some may be outside of your department. If possible through your system, use automation for sharing data. Treating each enquiry from a user as being due to a defect in the service itself is a very ambitious improvement model. Here enquiries are either seen as a fault in your support model for your service, or in the communications processes you use to handle enquiries. While this can exaggerate the reason for some kinds of contact (is a user’s email of thanks and appreciation genuinely a defect?) it’s an excellent way to direct critical thinking on how you provide service. Once the enquiry-level improvement data has been sent to the right group, begin doing analysis for improving processes. Join your enquiry level data with cost data to help prioritise which areas to target first. But you can also simply use the number (or percentage) of affected users as a tool for prioritising. In any case, make sure you have access to staff with experience in process analysis and improvement, ideally with relevant contact centre or technology experience. Directly involving the individuals who handle enquiries and those who built the service into improvement projects will produce better and faster results.","description":"Now you’ve created a helpdesk, it’s time to figure out how to make the best use of user feedback so you can improve your service and your user experience.","link":"/service-manual/operations/managing-user-support.html"},{"_type":"manual_section","organisations":["government-digital-service"],"manual":"service-manual","title":"Government Service Design Manual: Monitoring","indexable_content":"Set up monitoring early Include high-level checks Errors are interesting Make data widely available Further reading be alerted to problems affecting the availability of the service so they can be resolved help with capacity planning activities by providing metrics over time identify potential future problems find areas of improvement, eg badly performing systems or inefficient services be able to identify the root cause of an outage after the fact, based on data collected during the problematic event alert you to problems help identify the cause at the same time ground conversations about low-level problems (disk space, slow performance) in relation to service performance a user problem attacks in progress failing systems problems with capacity monitoring system dashboards interactive tools reports the Radiating Information blog post gives examples of some of the monitoring dashboards used while building GOV.UK open source monitoring explains some of the terminology and available open-source tools Any online application should have tools dedicated to alerting any problems to those running the service.

This way you’re more likely to build useful checks as you go along. Writing tests at the same time as writing code is common, monitoring checks can be viewed as tests for the running system. Often monitoring is seen through a very technical lens, so teams may only look at web application performance, available disk space or memory usage.

Don’t include ‘Middle names’ unless you absolutely have to and make sure it’s optional (you don’t need to mark it as optional as users will understand this).

Your department has its own Open Data Strategy (for 2012-2014) and will already be publishing data sets on data.gov.uk. Your commitment to open, public data doesn’t stop there. Your open data should be user-friendly and findable. You should support people who want to reuse it and provide guarantees about how it will be made available. Publishing on data.gov.uk makes your data findable and will tell you how it ranks on a 5-star rating scheme to indicate whether the data and the format that it is published in is open. You should aim to reach at least the 3-star standard. The Open Data Certificates from the Open Data Institute measure how usable the data is for people who want to reuse it, and help identify ways in which you can improve how you publish the data. You should get a certificate for your data. The Open Data Principles that you must follow are: Users are already using your services, giving you lots of data about their behaviour. This means you can learn from real world behaviour when you’re designing a new digital service. You can watch and learn from your users, shaping the system to fit what people naturally choose to do. Recognise that you can’t do it all. In making your data open, you are encouraging greater use of the data and helping users to innovate. Developers need to be able to use the data, to share it, and combine it with other data to use in their own applications, for example through application programming interfaces (APIs). As with all government digital services you’ll need to understand the user need for the data you publish. You’ll need to keep developers aware of what datasets you are releasing and to maintain relationships with those primary data users at the cutting edge of technology who can help you to do things differently and in more agile ways. You can use the engagement areas of data.gov.uk to reach out and keep in touch with data users. You need to be scrupulous in protecting individual privacy by taking appropriate steps to ensure personal data is secure. You should consider privacy issues at the beginning of all discussions concerning the release of a new dataset or the building of or change to a digital service dealing with personal data. If you are using new technology to handle personal data or reusing the data in a different way, you may need to carry out a Privacy Impact Assessment. This is an important part of the process for identifying and managing risk. The Cabinet Office is preparing a new Code of Practice (Datasets) (the consultation on this draft version is now closed). This code includes the licensing framework you must use when making your datasets available for reuse. There are a number of licenses in the framework. For UK government open data, this will be the Open Government Licence. Your open data can give: Building your services on open formats and open standards means that you can more easily share, reuse or exchange data. It will also mean that you will have a choice in which technology to implement, rather than being limited to a particular product or supplier. You can browse the apps section of data.gov.uk to see hundreds of applications that have been built using open government data. You can also find case studies of how people are sharing, using and building open data on the data.gov.uk site. The team at data.gov.uk is a good first point of contact for help in understanding how to make your data open. You can get in touch with them through data.gov.uk. The Open Data Institute and the Open Knowledge Foundation can give you advice and training on how to open up your data. The Government Statistical Service has developed computer-based training to help you to make the right decisions about how to make data available in open formats.","description":"Data that is truly open is:","link":"/service-manual/technology/open-data.html"},{"_type":"manual_section","organisations":["government-digital-service"],"manual":"service-manual","title":"Government Service Design Manual: Open programme","indexable_content":"Who should take part Supporting people to use your digital service Design and improve your digital service Practice, procurement and platforms for your digital service Request a place Design principles in action Always be testing Data-driven services Procurement, spend control and governance Being agile Identity assured      learn about why it’s important to support people to use your service         develop your understanding of why people might not use your digital service and how to overcome barriers         walk personas through a user journey, to see where they might need support and what that could look like         discuss the requirements of the Digital by Default Service Standard for these areas, covering expectations at each development phase         share your experience with other service managers and work together to improve your understanding of effective support for digital services.         discover the 10 design principles and how they were created         hear from a product manager who has used them on a project         consider how they will be applied to your own services         keep your team concentrating on real user needs         help teams design products which are prioritised by user needs          help teams iterate products in response to user feedback         discuss your service’s performance indicators as they currently stand         consider what data you currently use to inform your decision-making, and what data you would like to use         design your own performance data dashboard to understand your services in a simple, visual way         find out about the Performance Platform and how you can use it         consider how to procure tools and systems fit for the purpose of agile, user-centred development         discuss the range of options available, and how to determine make or buy decisions         hear the latest on the government procurement processes and frameworks available on digital transformations         agile artefacts, themes, epics and user stories         sprint planning and the use of walls to make shared priorities visible         retrospectives to continually inspect and improve the work teams do together         creating a market so that users can choose from a number of identity providers         setting standards for consistently meeting the needs of users, services and departments         building and running the hub that connects services to identity providers         working with departments and agencies to identify their services’ GOV.UK Verify requirements and plan their transition to using the GOV.UK Verify service    These 3 days contain specialist modules to help you succeed and improve in particular areas of the Digital by Default Service Standard. Unless already very familiar with digital in government, participants should complete either the specialist digital foundation day or the service manager induction before taking part in the open programme. All sessions will run at a central London location. The programme is funded centrally, but you or your department will need to pay for any accommodation, meals and subsistence expenses, in line with your departmental policies. This one day module will cover digital take-up, digital inclusion and assisted digital, and focuses on supporting your users to use your digital service. These are all areas required by the Digital by Default Service Standard. It’s essential to ‘shift’ people away from non-digital channels and increase the take-up of government digital services so more users can benefit from improved government services. Departments and agencies will also come under increasing pressure to deliver the return on the investment in digital services – estimated at between £1.7 and £1.8 billion per year. Digital inclusion helps people become capable of using and benefiting from the internet. This means that most users will be able to use new and redesigned government digital services unaided, but there are some who will need help through assisted digital support. You will: learn about why it’s important to support people to use your service develop your understanding of why people might not use your digital service and how to overcome barriers walk personas through a user journey, to see where they might need support and what that could look like discuss the requirements of the Digital by Default Service Standard for these areas, covering expectations at each development phase share your experience with other service managers and work together to improve your understanding of effective support for digital services. This one day module will cover the GOV.UK Design Principles, user research and data-driven services. These are all areas required by the Digital by Default Service Standard. A set of simple but powerful design principles underpin all the work done by GDS to develop the award-winning GOV.UK website. In this session your group will: discover the 10 design principles and how they were created hear from a product manager who has used them on a project consider how they will be applied to your own services Carry out user research in every stage of your project. Do it continuously through each stage – don’t leave it as something that happens at the beginning and end of phases. You will find out how doing user research continuously will: keep your team concentrating on real user needs help teams design products which are prioritised by user needs  help teams iterate products in response to user feedback Using data to inform decision-making is vital to the development of your services. Your group will: discuss your service’s performance indicators as they currently stand consider what data you currently use to inform your decision-making, and what data you would like to use design your own performance data dashboard to understand your services in a simple, visual way find out about the Performance Platform and how you can use it This one day module will cover governance, procurement and spend control in an agile context, along with an overview of the GOV.UK Verify platform. These are all areas required by the Digital by Default Service Standard. Delivering high quality digital services that improve continuously often depends on effective procurement. As a group you will: consider how to procure tools and systems fit for the purpose of agile, user-centred development discuss the range of options available, and how to determine make or buy decisions hear the latest on the government procurement processes and frameworks available on digital transformations GDS delivery managers will lead discussions and exercises around key features of agile, such as: agile artefacts, themes, epics and user stories sprint planning and the use of walls to make shared priorities visible retrospectives to continually inspect and improve the work teams do together We need to know that users of digital services are who they say they are. In this session, you will learn how the GOV.UK Verify Programme is: creating a market so that users can choose from a number of identity providers setting standards for consistently meeting the needs of users, services and departments building and running the hub that connects services to identity providers working with departments and agencies to identify their services’ GOV.UK Verify requirements and plan their transition to using the GOV.UK Verify service The GDS Skills Team will invite all service manager induction and foundation day participants to book their places on the open programme.

Broadly this concludes the quality of the software is the primary driver for security, rather than the license model. Closed or open source code is not more or less secure in the majority of cases due to licensing alone. The licensing model doesn’t really have an impact on how you use software. You need to consider the same things as part of selecting technology: Open Source has a vibrant commercial ecosystem, and lots of companies provide support or work on proprietary and open source software. What varies is generally how you buy something (licenses vs pure support), what that means for internal skills and ultimately your rights to modify the software for your needs.

Completed challenges – go here on the Standards Hub to find out which standards profiles are compulsory for use in government. Open Standards Principles Open Standards: Open Opportunities consultation outcome This information is to be used as guidance on using open standards and why they matter, and should not be taken as legal advice. GDS define open standards for software interoperability, data, and document formats as those that meet all of these criteria: The standard is maintained by working together in a decision-making process that is consensus-based and independent of any individual supplier. Involvement in the development and maintenance of the standard is accessible to all interested parties. The decision-making process is transparent and a review is carried out by subject matter experts, which is open to the public. To guarantee quality, the standard is taken on by a specification or standardisation organisation, or a forum or consortium with a feedback and approval process. The standard is published, thoroughly documented, and publicly available at zero or low cost. Other than creating innovative solutions, the standard is supported by the market and displays platform, application and vendor independence. Rights are essential to the implementation of the standard, and for communicating with other implementations using that same standard. They’re licensed on a royalty-free basis that’s compatible with both open source and proprietary licensed solutions. These rights should be irrevocable unless there is a breach of licence conditions. There are 7 open standards principles to follow when thinking about which open standards to use: GDS describe the reasons for these principles and their implications in ‘Open Standards Principles’, published in November 2012. The Open Standards Board will be selecting some compulsory open standards using the Standards Hub process. Use standards that have been identified. There might be instances where you’re looking for an open standard and GDS have not set a compulsory one in that space. If so, do a thorough assessment of existing standards and choose one that meets your needs and is consistent with GDS’s definitions. You should also consider how the standard fits with: You’ll need to apply for exemptions to open standards if: By implementing open standards for software interoperability, data and document formats, government is: Basing your build of component-based digital services on open standards will: Expressing your user needs in terms of required capabilities, which are in turn based on open standards, helps you to make better choices for service delivery. It also means that there is no unintentional lock-in built into government digital services.

The government’s Chief Technology Officer will agree this, or it could also be through Departmental Accounting Officer procedures for cases below the Cabinet Office’s spend controls threshold for IT.","description":"This information is to be used as guidance on using open standards and why they matter, and should not be taken as legal advice.","link":"/service-manual/making-software/open-standards-and-licensing.html"},{"_type":"manual_section","organisations":["government-digital-service"],"manual":"service-manual","title":"Government Service Design Manual: Operating a service.gov.uk subdomain","indexable_content":"One entry point Creating a domain Subdomains Transport Layer Security Cookies robots.txt and root level redirections Origin servers for CDN-based provider of DDOS protection Emails sent to service users Lifecycle of service subdomains www.servicename.service.gov.uk is for the public facing, dynamic web pages that make up your service. assets.servicename.service.gov.uk is for assets such as static images and shared JavaScript files needed to run your live service (note: written content about the service, such as guides to eligibility or detailed guidance for applicants, SHOULD be on GOV.UK) admin.servicename.service.gov.uk is for features that enable non-technical staff to run the service (eg contact centre staff might use this subdomain to access and process work items where human judgement is needed)      have a robots.txt file on the www, admin and assets subdomains asking search engines not to index any part of the site.

Note: This does not apply to the set of interactive tools on GOV.UK known as ‘smart answers’ which are developed and maintained by GDS in partnership with other government departments.  Government offers a number of different digital services to citizens. While the start and end of a user’s journey will be on GOV.UK, the service itself will typically be hosted elsewhere, and will need a different domain name as a result. This page describes the use of service.gov.uk subdomains for hosting digital services. Note: This document is written as a ‘standard’, and as such uses the words MUST, SHOULD, MAY and MUST NOT as defined in RFC 2119. Every digital service offered by the UK government MUST have a single, well-known place on the internet where users can go to when they want to use the service. That well-known place will be the relevant start page on GOV.UK – for instance, the DVLA’s tax disc service is at https://www.gov.uk/tax-disc. Service managers MUST NOT advertise any URL other than that of the GOV.UK start page as the starting point for the relevant service. This is what gets printed in literature and used in email signatures, TV adverts etc. The start page URL for a given service will be allocated by GDS based on discussions with the service manager and analysis of user behaviour, search referrals and other relevant data. The transactional part of a service – the dynamically generated pages where users interact with the service – will typically not be hosted on the www.gov.uk domain. That means that each service needs its own domain name for the transactional part of the service. Note: This does not apply to the set of interactive tools on GOV.UK known as ‘smart answers’ which are developed and maintained by GDS in partnership with other government departments. For all new digital government services going live from 1 April 2013 GDS will create a domain name of the form servicename.service.gov.uk (where “servicename” is a plain English description of the service agreed between the relevant dept/agency and the Government Digital Service). This will introduce consistency across central government domains for digital services and remove the dependency on departmental subdomains (which are of course vulnerable to machinery of government changes) and the now-retired DirectGov and BusinessLink online brands. The process of obtaining a service.gov.uk subdomain begins either when the service manager asks a Government Digital Service product manager for a start page on GOV.UK (for services already under development as of 13 March 2013) or when the service manager asks for a subdomain to be created via the GOV.UK service desks’s government contact form (for services where development starts after 13 March 2013).  Subdomains of service.gov.uk SHOULD describe the service (eg lastingpowerofattorney.service.gov.uk) and should not contain the name of the service owning department or agency (eg ministryofmagicwandregistration.service.gov.uk) The service-owning dept/agency will be given delegated authority to manage the domain and its subdomains, although in some cases this work will be carried out by third party suppliers. This section gives some guidance about which subdomains a service manager should create once they have been given control of servicename.service.gov.uk. Maximum number of visible subdomains The user-facing live service SHOULD be operated using at most three user-visible subdomains of servicename.service.gov.uk: You SHOULD NOT create separate domains for application programming interfaces (APIs) unless there’s a really good reason to have a completely separate domain. (Really good reasons are few and far between.) Service managers should notify the Government Digital Service technical architects (via your transformation team contact) if you intend to create user-visible subdomains other than the three listed above. We’re developing some patterns for more unusual system designs as well as for mainstream transactional services, and we’re always up for a discussion about exceptions and edge cases. Usernames and passwords If the service is a private alpha or private beta release then it should be protected by a username and password known only to the development team and the users who are testing the service. If a service, or part of a service, is a public alpha or beta releases then it should be clearly marked as such with a text label on every page (ie don’t use an image containing the word alpha or beta) and in every API response. Multiple environments It is good practice to have multiple ‘environments’ for the development, testing and live (aka production) versions of any service. The development and testing environments allow the team to assess the correctness and quality of the service before it goes live. Typically, the subdomains used to access a development or testing instance of the service are structured in the same way as the subdomains used in the live version of the service. Therefore, you MAY create other subdomains of servicename.service.gov.uk for use in testing and development, such as www-preview. and www-dev, or www.preview. and www.dev.. If there’s a compelling reason to use a non .gov.uk domain for testing and/or development subdomains, that’s also acceptable. Regardless of the domain name used, web-based services on testing and development domains (including APIs) should be protected by a username and password along the same lines as private alpha and beta releases. Many services will collect personal information from users. It’s very important that this information can’t be intercepted by malicious third parties as it travels over the internet. Therefore, all services accessed through service.gov.uk domains (including APIs) MUST only be accessible through secure connections. For web-based services this means HTTPS only (often referred to by the acronyms TLS or SSL, which both refer to the protocol underpinning these secure connections). Services must not accept HTTP connections under any circumstances. Once a service manager has verified that their HTTPS setup is working fine they SHOULD enable HSTS on the production domains (www., admin. and assets.), by setting an HTTP response header such as representing a commitment to HTTPS-only traffic for 14 days. Once the service manager is confident that HSTS is configured correctly, they SHOULD increase the commitment to months or years: Cookies used on www.servicename.service.gov.uk and admin.servicename.service.gov.uk MUST be scoped to the originating domain only. Cookies MUST NOT be scoped to the domain servicename.service.gov.uk. Cookies SHOULD NOT be used on assets.servicename.service.gov.uk (they introduce a browser overhead that slows down the response time for users without providing any benefit for the service manager). Cookies MUST be sent with the Secure attribute and SHOULD, where appropriate, be sent with the HttpOnly attribute. These flags provide additional assurances about how cookies will be handled by browsers. GOV.UK is the place for users to find all government services, so it’s important to ensure that users always start on the relevant GOV.UK page, rather than a different or duplicate start page on www.servicename.service.gov.uk. As a result, services need to ask search engines not to index pages on their domains, so that the relevant GOV.UK page and the service domain don’t compete with each other in search engine results. This can be achieved by redirecting users to the relevant GOV.UK start page if they go directly to the service’s domain name, and by asking search engines not to index pages on the service’s domain name. Therefore, every service hosted on a service.gov.uk domain MUST: have a robots.txt file on the www, admin and assets subdomains asking search engines not to index any part of the site. Example content for robots.txt is given below, and more details can be found on The Web Robots Pages: have an HTTP 301 redirection from the top-level index page of the www and assets subdomains to the relevant start page on GOV.UK. (Note: this means that the service start page on GOV.UK SHOULD NOT link to the root of the www domain.) If you have contracted with CDN-based DDOS-protection suppliers then you should register these additional subdomains for use by your suppliers: Your suppliers will use these subdomains to address your www, admin and assets services. Detailed configuration advice for origin servers is outside of the scope of this document, but it’s important to ensure that these ‘origin domains’ only listen for traffic from trusted sources like: At present we advise against allowing DDOS protection suppliers to terminate SSL connections for transactional services carrying personal information, but this behaviour isn’t prohibited at present. Although SSL termination on the third party network would allow the supplier(s) to carry out additional analysis and potentially extra mitigations against certain types of attack, it would also give the supplier access to all the personal information being submitted to your service.  There are obvious downsides to allowing this level of access, especially if the supplier’s network and processes have not been accredited to the same level as the rest of the service. It’s a risk-based decision, but if in doubt we suggest a presumption against SSL termination on third party networks. Many suppliers offer IP forwarding DDOS protection, which does not have the same security issues as SSL termination, and is recommended in preference to SSL termination.  If your service requires transaction monitoring (which is not at all the same thing as DDOS protection) you should contact your CESG account manager for advice. Emails to users of your service SHOULD be sent from a human-monitored email address that originates from the domain servicename.service.gov.uk (and not the dept/agency or any other domain name). You SHOULD enable SPF on the sending domain. You MAY also want to use DKIM on the sending domain; it can provide additional guarantees about message delivery and help recipients to more easily distinguish genuine mail from forgery. If your service should need to wind down for any reason, you MUST ensure continued useful service and information for users by: For services that have been live for less than 6 months, you MUST continue to do the above for the remainder of a year total. For services that have been live longer than that you MUST continue to do the above for a further 12 months or until the expiry of the current SSL certificate, whichever comes first. The GOV.UK start page will be amended to explain that the service is no longer running, and cease to provide a start button pointing at the defunct service.","description":"Government offers a number of different digital services to citizens.

Measure these in addition to the four core KPIs: Different sets of users within each department will typically have their own requirements for each service. On a daily basis, a service manager will need to see a range of metrics that help them make decisions about the service. Identify the various stakeholders in your organisation and prioritise their requirements. These could be: These needs will typically be reflected in the organisation’s business objectives or in the business case for transforming a service. An approach that worked well for GOV.UK was to run a brainstorming session to generate a long list of metrics. This list was then narrowed down by asking senior managers, ‘if you had to choose one KPI, what would it be?’ Develop simple, actionable and collectible metrics based on your understanding of user and stakeholder needs. Identify where that information will come from and how frequently it will be needed. Think especially about the functions your service is relying on and try to identify some KPIs to ensure you are constantly monitoring and improving these functions. Measure things like: Record every event generated by the system even if it’s not currently of interest. Measure everything (where it’s cost-effective and practical to do so). This will make it much easier to revise your chosen metrics later on, and customise data visualisations to different audiences.

Sometimes referred to as pen testing, vulnerability and penetration testing is the act of analysing and testing a service for security problems. This is often a specialist activity done via a third party. View security testing as an ongoing activity in your project, and not as a final check. Security is important to a product and its audience. It’s essential that non-technical audiences understand vulnerability testing reports and the risks they identify, as well developers. Security isn’t just about whether a product secure or not – it’s also about reducing the risks of a wide range of issues. Get an independent body to help find potential security problems in your system/application before it’s released to the public, as this helps to identify its vulnerabilities. CESG is the National Technical Authority for Information Assurance. Based at Cheltenham, they provide both standards and advice for information security. If your project is fairly large, contact CESG as early as possible. They can provide guidance and expertise on potential problems and help you to make sure the right things are tested. Test for security issues throughout the development of your service, as well as regular testing when your service is live.  Having third parties do this testing is a good way of introducing genuine experts and getting a different view on something. However it’s also important to make sure that your team building the software know that security is their responsibility, and not something that is outsourced. When testing for vulnerability, look at the whole system and not just the software involved, such as: An obvious example would be physical security (where is the equipment housed and how secure is it?) but a more interesting example is often the interplay between an online system and a call centre. From using information available from a call centre it’s possible to exploit the software system in some way. For instance, getting a call-centre team to change an email address on record for someone else, and then using a forgotten password facility, which relies on the email address being trusted, to access the account. It can and does happen. Some exploratory manual testing is always a good idea when looking for vulnerabilities, but as this is time-consuming and expensive, also have some level of automation. This may take the form of tests written or tools used specifically to test the security of a feature, eg: The web is a hostile environment, and the nature of government services means they can be targets for a wide range of different threats – from financially motivated criminals and online activists up to nation states. Even where personal or sensitive information is not at risk, the smallest issues can damage the reputation of government. Exploits of web application tend to follow a relatively small number of common patterns. Automated and manual testing, as well as awareness of these common problems, can have a drastic effect on the security of your system. The Government Accreditation processes mandate some form of vulnerability testing, often working with CHECK approved suppliers. View this as the minimum amount of effort required.","description":"Making sure your web-based systems and applications are secure requires more than just good design and development.","link":"/service-manual/operations/penetration-testing.html"},{"_type":"manual_section","organisations":["government-digital-service"],"manual":"service-manual","title":"Government Service Design Manual: Digital performance analyst","indexable_content":"Job description Personal specification – competencies and skills required support the service manager to make sure their service meets the performance requirements set out in the Digital by Default Service Standard communicate service performance against key indicators to internal and external stakeholders ensure high-quality analysis of departmental transaction data support the procurement of the necessary digital platforms to support automated and real-time collection and presentation of data share examples of best practice in digital performance management across government identify delivery obstacles to improving transactional performance in \tdepartments and working with teams to overcome those obstacles be alert to emerging issues and trends which might impact or benefit own and team’s work understand how the services, activities and strategies in the area work together to create value for the user make sure own area/team activities are aligned to departmental priorities identifing a range of relevant and credible information sources and recognise the need to collect new data when necessary from internal and external sources recognising patterns and trends in a wide range of evidence and draw important conclusions exploring different options outlining costs, benefits, risks and potential responses to each inviting challenge and where appropriate involve others in decision making to help build engagement and present robust recommendations communicate using appropriate styles, methods and timing, including digital channels, to maximise understanding and impact communicate in a succinct, engaging manner and stand ground when needed convey enthusiasm and energy about their work and encourage others to do the same promote the work of the department and play an active part in supporting the civil service values and culture proactively manage own career and identify own learning needs with line manager, plan and carry out workplace learning opportunities continually seek and act on feedback to evaluate and improve their own and team’s performance make effective use of project management skills and techniques to deliver outcomes, including identifying risks and mitigating actions develop, implement, maintain and review systems and service standards to provide quality, efficiency and value for money establish mechanisms to seek out and respond to feedback from customers about service provided make sure there is efficient and effective use of resources to deliver programmes and projects on time, within budgets and to agreed quality standards regularly monitor own and team’s work against targets act promptly to keep work on track and maintain performance plan ahead but reassess workloads and priorities if situations change or people are facing conflicting demands familiarity with data analysis, web analytics and visualisation tools essential eg Google Analytics, Google Refine, Tableau etc experience of providing performance analysis and recommendations on digital public services Digital Performance Analysts sit at the heart of a team, working to specify, collect and present the key performance data and analysis for their service.

Sometimes an application may require one or more ‘wet signatures’ to validate it, or print alternatives may be part of your assisted digital support. For the most part you can approach these as design challenges like any other – the Design Principles are a great way to start this work – but there are some specific things you’ll want to bear in mind. The most important thing to remember is that print forms should only be made when absolutely necessary. For example, the legislation governing Lasting Powers of Attorney (LPA) requires ‘wet signatures’ for the application to be valid. Until this legislation changes, a print form has to be part of the final service. Aim for as much of the transaction as possible to be completed online. Users should have to print as little as possible in order to complete an application, which means: In lots of cases, paper forms will exist for services being redesigned. The launch of the digital service gives you an opportunity to improve them. When doing so, don’t just base your designs on the existing forms. Look at what information you need to carry out the transaction and try to eliminate unnecessary steps.   Performance data should be available for the existing forms. This will tell you about the most common options people select and the kinds of mistakes they make. This will be useful information while you design the new forms. Links, smart answers, search boxes and drop downs are not available in print publications. If a transaction requires multiple forms you will need to make sure the design and layout helps users navigate them as easily as their online counterparts.  In the Lasting Power of Attorney application forms, this meant:   Your paper forms are a small but important part of a digital process. Typically you’ll be switching to paper forms to collect a signature. There are some ways you can make this transition easier: You should test your paper forms with real users. For complex forms, plan for 3 rounds of lab testing, making improvements to the form between each round. You’ll gain valuable insight by attending the user research in person. Get an introduction to user research and find out about all the different kinds of testing. Templates (based on the Lasting Power of Attorney application) created by teams across government will help you make easy-to-complete forms, but lots of the ‘heavy-lifting’ will be in making specialist terms and language accessible to the majority of users. Where specialist terms are unavoidable, or necessary, you’ll need people who understand how users read and how best to write for government services when working on the design. Skilled content designers and copywriters will make forms – whether online or in print – simpler and clearer, improving the completion rate and user satisfaction in the process. They complement the digital transaction and should be easy to process by staff supporting the digital service. Their performance also has an impact on the KPIs you gather for digital services.

(The redesigned LPA forms will be made public soon by the Ministry of Justice as part of a formal consultation.)

Even that can fail, but without HTML there is no web page and everything else becomes moot. The attitude towards building for the web with this in mind is called progressive enhancement. This means in essence that each extra layer (images, styling, behaviour, video, audio) of a page should be seen as optional. If you build pages with the idea that parts other than HTML are optional, you’ll create a better and stronger web page. Make any new page or feature work with HTML alone – no images, no CSS, no JavaScript, nothing but HTML. Interactive elements are only those capable of being implemented with forms and server-side processing. This gives a baseline experience, which will work in practically every browser. It allows your site to work for as many people and devices as possible, including older legacy browsers and devices. From this baseline, extra layers can then be added: Remember to see each addition as just that – an addition. Additions are just something extra that the more modern browsers are capable of doing. That’s along with an already accessible and usable experience that has as much content and interactivity available as possible. A common misunderstanding is that designing sites to work without CSS, JavaScript or anything else is because a user chooses to switch it off, considering it as an error or mistake on their part. It isn’t just a case of “fix your browser”. There are many scenarios where the extra layers can fail to load or are deliberately filtered, which can be due to: Of course, there are people who do turn off features in their browsers deliberately. Respect their decision and still provide them with a usable and useful service. Another common misunderstanding is that progressive enhancement is only about JavaScript - it’s not. Treat anything other than HTML as an enhancement, not just JavaScript. Adding an image to a page requires suitable alternative text (and may also need a longer description) for people with visual impairment, and simply for when the image fails to load. Styling cannot be the only way to share information:","description":"When creating web pages, the only part of a page that you can rely upon working is the HTML.

Quality is the responsibility of every member of your team – the people who create the service create the quality of it.

Fundamentally it is about the experience of the service’s users, from the start to the end of the transaction, which may include: ‘Technical debt’ is a common term in software development, and definitions vary. Generally, technical debt is used to describe compromises made to complete a product’s development, instead of creating a clean, expandable technical design. These compromises mean there’s still work to be done, even though the overall product is finished. It’s impossible to develop your software without building up some technical debt, so make sure your team have some way of sharing an understanding of the technical debt in their system. A large amount of technical debt will slow down future development.  Know how much of it you have and you can prioritise work to reduce it, and can continue to iterate rapidly in the future. Service quality isn’t just a testing issue or the responsibility of a few individuals. The quality of a system is defined by the people who create it.  Your team should be able to see any problems in the quality of your system. Every person on the project should be taking action to increase quality and fix issues. You won’t know how great your product is or if it meets your criteria without testing it – in both normal and unusual conditions. Dylan Robert’s book “Learning From First Responders” is worth reviewing as an example of testing software and teams under unusual stresses (in this case, the final stages of the 2012 presidential campaign). This manual gives further information on testing: The quality of any digital service is the responsibility of the entire team, but the final responsibility lies with the service manager. Make sure your service manager works with the rest of your team. Otherwise you risk your team not understanding what measures they need to put in place to guarantee quality.

How often you want to do this will affect how you design and build applications, and will present a number of challenges that this guide hopes to address. As early as possible in your product’s development, think about how you release updates to a running application. This is because it affects how software is developed and tested, and how your product may be supported. Being able to release software on demand is important. Release cycles of 6 months or longer are dangerous. Not only do new features rarely see the light of day, but known problems will have to be fixed within a rigid release schedule. It’s important to make the distinction between: Your application should always be in a state where it could be released, meaning quick changes can be made when needed. As an example, changes to the software running GOV.UK are made on average 5 times per day. To be able to do this, you have to consider: Although you need tools (potentially including commercial tools) to help with rapid releases, don’t start your discussions around what tools should be used or procured! Start discussions based on the needs of the service and the product team. In some organisations, people fear releasing new applications or new versions of software. Lots of websites, especially large applications within large traditional organisations, don’t change very often. Many will have fixed release schedules which might mean 1 release every 6 months or so. This means bundling up lots of changes into a single release, which is bad in at least 2 ways: It could be weeks or months before an improvement is actually released for people to use, even though it only took a few days to finish. This complexity means there are lots of different ways the release can go wrong. The combination of complexity, risk, and the infrequent nature of releases make for a stressful event for all involved. No wonder most people don’t like release day! Releasing software comes with risks, so trying to minimise those risks is a good idea. GDS does this in a number of ways, and the benefit of this is that: As well as reducing risk, being able to release early and often also helps products improve quickly, as it removes barriers to quick experiments and rapid iteration. Finally, consider the following 2 measures of a system: A very traditional approach involves working to reduce the time between any failures happening, hopefully improving the quality of the overall system. But problems will always happen at some point! Using your efforts to reduce the time taken to fix problems can often be much more cost effective, as well as improving the overall system uptime.","description":"Constantly improving online services means releasing updates to the underlying software.

Each session usually includes tasks being given to see how users interact with the website/online service and are followed up with a series of questions about their perceptions and how easy it was to complete the tasks. As there is no moderator present, special software is used in order to record the user’s interactions with the website/online service. While traditional lab testing focuses of gathering rich and detailed information, remote usability testing aims to test with large numbers of users and produce statistically significant results. It is recommended that remote testing is not conducted in isolation, and face to face testing is also completed. Remote usability testing can be used to test both website content, and online services. Testing content normally involves people completing tasks based on the online content, while online services are normally tested by asking users to complete a task using the online tool or transaction (like claiming Jobseeker’s Allowance or applying for a driving licence). Success is measured on whether the user can complete the tasks or transaction. Benchmarks on new and existing products are gathered so that completion rates (and other success measures) be collected and performance monitored. The key advantage of remote usability testing are that it: Although remote usability provides testing with large numbers of people, findings can lack depth as they focus on what people do, and not why they have done it. When testing new products the tasks can seem artificial, and this is increased when testing is conducted with a panel of users, instead of real users on a live site. Remote usability testing should not be used in isolation and it is recommended that it is used in conjunction with face to face testing with real users. In order to test new products that are still in development it is necessary to engage an online panel in order to recruit participants. Existing products and services can be testing via the live website. It is recommended that 400 responses are collected so that results are robust.

We redirected as many of the old sites’ URLs as we could to corresponding GOV.UK URLs, and provided ‘Gone’ pages with links to the National Archive where the content was not being transferred. We wrote about that in “No Link Left Behind”.  Even the best services may eventually reach retirement. Changes in policy may mean that the service is no longer offered or new understanding may mean that those user needs are better provided through a different service. Whatever the reason, the retirement of digital services should be handled with the same degree of care as their creation, concentrating on user needs. Your service will have been built to serve user needs. It’s vital to understand how those needs are to be addressed once your service has been retired, whether they are deemed to no longer exist, are no longer served by government, or will in future be served as part of another service. If the needs will no longer be met by government but will now be met by the private or voluntary sectors then it’s important to for these organisations to be adequately prepared. This means that the appropriate online user journey can be developed. Similarly, if the needs are to be served as part of another government service or services then you should identify which services they are and work with those services’ teams. This means the new teams can learn from your experience and you can understand how you’ll support your users to make the transition. The vast majority of users of your service will begin and end their journeys via GOV.UK. As soon as you know that your service is likely to be retired you should contact the GOV.UK team to make sure that those journeys are amended and appropriate information is supplied. The GOV.UK team will need to know why the service is being retired, and how those user needs are to be served in future so that they can provide the appropriate information, advice and links to users. For that majority of users who begin and end their journeys on GOV.UK the most important thing is to ensure that GOV.UK is updated. There will be some users, however, who access your service directly whether via links in emails, bookmarks on their computer or remembering your URLs. It’s important to prepare them for the change and lay out clearly what it will mean to them. Your planning should aim to produce the minimum possible disruption for users, but it will still be a significant change for them. Details of what the change is, why it’s being made, what they will need to do, and what will happen to their data should be made easily available. Users who access your service via an application programming interface (API) will need time to update their software to use the replacement service’s APIs or to make other relevant adjustments. You should reach out to your API users as early as possible and remember that they may have significant lead times for making and distributing changes. Changes to the service online will also need to be seamlessly tied in with messaging to offline users who are receiving the service through assisted digital channels. Once GOV.UK is updated the vast majority of users will begin to be directed to the new service. Some users will still try to access the service at its current (now retired) home. You should have a plan for redirecting those requests to the appropriate new service, or to provide clear information about the service that has been retired in perpetuity. When we retired the DirectGov, BusinessLink and departmental websites, we invested a lot of effort in mapping content on those sites to GOV.UK content. We redirected as many of the old sites’ URLs as we could to corresponding GOV.UK URLs, and provided ‘Gone’ pages with links to the National Archive where the content was not being transferred. We wrote about that in “No Link Left Behind”. If you operate a service.gov.uk subdomain, please read your technical responsibilities for ending your service. In running your service you will have accrued a large amount of data about the service and its users. You should already have policies in place to manage that data responsibly, including details of how long it will be retained. Those policies will continue to apply, and you will need to ensure that there is support in place to maintain them. Where data is being transferred to a new service owner, that should be done in accordance with your existing data protection policies, and communicated clearly to your users.","description":"Even the best services may eventually reach retirement.

Agile Retrospectives: Making Good Teams Great. Getting Value out of Agile Retrospectives – Free eBook with many exercises for facilitating retrospectives, supported with the “what” and “why” of retrospectives, the business value and benefits that they bring, and advice for introducing and improving retrospectives. A central principle of agile is quick feedback loops – you demonstrate something to the user as soon as possible so you can see how well it suits their needs. Retrospectives are the way we apply this to our own teams to find out what’s working and what isn’t, so a team can continuously improve.  A retrospective is a meeting at the end of a sprint where your team get a chance to talk about what went well and badly in that sprint, and take some actions to improve matters. It can also cover a larger scope, eg a full project retrospective. A retrospective takes this form: This is a chance for everyone in your team to contribute to improving process/productivity.  All retrospectives must be facilitated. The facilitator’s role is to give everyone a chance to talk about their concerns and give positive feedback. At the same time, they make sure the meeting remains a structured, productive meeting and doesn’t become overly negative. Ideally, your facilitator will be someone outside of your team so your whole team can contribute, but it’s not essential. The facilitator needs to: You’ll find it helpful to have some working agreements for a retrospective. These can be stated if necessary, eg in the first retrospective your team has. Working agreements could be that:  During the discussion you will uncover some successes you can celebrate, as well as some problems that you can fix or things you can improve. Make a list of actions that will address these. Aim to have done them within the next sprint or iteration. Some problems may take longer to fix, in which case you should try to make an action that will start the process of improving it by your next retrospective. Actions should: Retrospectives should follow up on the actions of previous retrospectives to make sure they’ve been completed. If they’re consistently not getting done, you may have too many.  You can use this template for your retrospectives. It’s based on a team of 8 to 10 and covers a 2-week sprint. 90 minutes is a reasonable amount of time to use for this scope and amount of people. Each of the activities is timeboxed (has a set time it will run for), and it’s your facilitator’s job to make sure that your team stick to this. Build in about 10% ‘shuffle time’ to move between activities to make sure it doesn’t overrun. Explain the scope and, if necessary, purpose. If your team don’t know each other and/or are shy, include brief introductions. Make sure they’ve been completed. If any haven’t, ask if:  Give your team around 10 minutes to write down all the things that went well in the previous 2 weeks on post-it notes. If anonymity is important to encourage free expression, collect them in and add them to the wall yourself. If not, have the team take turns adding their own post-its to the wall, possibly saying a few words about each. Don’t allow this to develop into a discussion at this point – you just want to gather data. Group the post-its into common themes. If there are too many to discuss in the time you have then have the team prioritise, eg by voting with stickers. Discuss each of the main areas in turn: Give the team around 15 minutes to write post-its for anything that went badly. Again, group the post-its, prioritise if necessary, and discuss the main areas:  Spend some time looking at the actions identified; assign them to people present and set realistic deadlines for completion. Total: 80 minutes with 10% shuffle time. It’s OK to finish early if people have said what they need to. It’s not OK to overrun – if there is too much to say, have the team prioritise the top areas for discussion and/or book more time for the next retrospective.

Where standard remote usability testing focuses on large numbers, and providing statistically significant findings, this type of testing enables you to get rich, qualitative data from respondents that would normally only be possible by observing users in person. As there is no moderator present, each session is recorded via screen capture software, that records the whole session, including the user talking about what they are doing, why they are doing it, and how they feel about it etc. All interviews are conducted in one hour, with the video sessions, and the answers to the follow up questions made available immediately. Analysis is then conducted in house. Rapid 1:1 testing can be used to test both website content, and online services. Each session involves participants completing a series of online tasks to see how they use the website or tool to find information and/or complete transactions. Each participant is then asked a few follow up questions focusing on overall satisfaction with the site and the experience it provided. The key advantages of remote usability testing are that it: Although this type of remote usability testing can provide depth of content, the lack of moderation can result in respondents veering off topic and the analysis be quite lengthy. Also, respondents can sometimes appear to be ‘professional testers’, and therefore can perform tasks with greater ease than other users. Testing is normally conducted using the online panel that is available through the panel company.

Consideration needs to be given to how the sample is collected (who, how, where, when) and the size of the sample collected for each study. A large sample size can be more accurate and provide greater confidence in the data collected, however a large sample is not required for all research projects. The sample method chosen should consider the size and scale of the project, the sub-group analysis required, and balance the robustness of the approach that with the time, money, and resource available to ensure its fit for purpose. Sampling can be a complex process to understand, but on most occasions a sample of 400-500 will be sufficient for most in-house studies – again this is dependent on the level of subgroup analysis needed and also the penetration of the target group in the population. The greater the number of population groups that need to be analysed may increase the sample size needed, as typically for findings to be statistically valid a minimum of 100 in a subgroup is required. A larger overall sample of 1000+ is normally required if findings need to be nationally representative.

GDS has created a repository called the GOV.UK Frontend Toolkit to simplify the creation of services with a consistent look and feel. The toolkit is available as a gem for easy inclusion in Ruby projects. The files in the gem can be categorised into four main parts: The first part is the bit that gives all GOV.UK projects a familiar look. There are a collection of pre-defined font sizes that we use on GOV.UK. There is a mixin for each one, for example heading-26. These also include a standard amount of whitespace around the text to help with vertical rhythm on the page, spacing things out nicely. The second is a way to develop sites that are able to respond to different sized displays. The third is an easy way of writing Internet Explorer specific CSS in our stylesheets without using hacks. The fourth is a way to keep browser specific styles out of our projects. We encapsulate new or non-standardised CSS into mixins. In this way we can easily update all the instances of a new CSS property without having to do a search and replace across all our projects. It is generally advised to write your markup with a mobile first attitude. That is, add desktop styles to an otherwise narrow screen stylesheet. In this way you only add styles for desktop and don’t reset desktop styles for a mobile device. There are two main types of cross browser CSS that we are concerned with. Firstly using different techniques to achieve a consistent effect and secondly using vendor prefixes to apply consistent behaviour for newer features. For example: @extend %contain-floats uses a cross-browser technique to ensure that the element wraps all the floated elements within it. It is not a property that normally exists in CSS but is something we often need to do and don’t want to use different techniques everywhere. It gives us consistency across our code. @include border-radius is designed to use the different border radius implementations (-moz-border-radius, -webkit-border-radius etc) to create consistent presentation across different browsers.

The process of increasing or decreasing team size is known as ‘scaling’. Delivery of digital services is best achieved through a small multidisciplinary team using an agile approach. However, you should recognise that you may need to scale up or down to meet your goals as you move through the phases in the life of the service.  Every service will have different needs over its lifetime. Typically during discovery and alpha you’ll need a small team to experiment, try stuff out and solve the harder potential problems on the project. Moving to beta and live, the team will be delivering a set of capabilities iteratively with regular user testing. You often need to scale up during beta, and sometimes in live when a change is big. You should only scale up when you already have a well-formed team delivering consistently. Scale according to service needs, instead of trying to scale across the entire organisation. This will mean you increase capacity only when you absolutely need to. You can scale up by adding people to existing teams or by creating new ones. It’s better to increase the size of existing teams until it becomes impractical. If this happens, consider adding more teams. Scale incrementally instead of resourcing to peak capacity from an early stage. New business case arrangements and use of procurement frameworks allow you to build your team as the work requires. It’s easy to forget about reducing teams and team size to match the work throughout the life of your service. When a service moves from beta to live, more user needs will have been met and there’s typically less remaining work. Whilst you must continuously, iteratively improve your service over time, you won’t always need the same size of team as you did during peak development, so think about how and when to scale down. You’ll need to plan to scale down carefully. Review the service roadmap, release plans and product backlog with your team to determine when and how to scale down. Consider whether it’s sensible to merge teams. Bear in mind that remaining team members will need time to reorganise their work. Read about GDS’ experience in scaling from a single team of 12 people to 14 teams in 18 months.

Government IT is more appropriately mapped into distinct areas with different user needs — some are public facing, and some are for internal use. These areas include: These 4 areas are in very different stages of development. Digital public services, for example, are being built by developers using very new technologies. In contrast, technology infrastructure such as data storage has evolved over the course of decades. Products which 5 or 10 years ago would have required detailed and expensive customisation are now commoditised (packaged as ‘pay-as-you-go’) – to the extent where they have virtually become utility services like gas or electricity (you can move between suppliers easily). By using technology based on commodity products and services government can benefit from economies of scale and much greater efficiency. Improvements to digital and technology leadership will create a new way of working in government, supporting teams across the civil service in producing digital public services and better department-specific IT (or mission IT), and ensuring these teams have the right technology to support them. For this to happen, government digital and technology leadership should be strongly represented at board level and be specifically responsible for enabling business change. In many cases digital services and department-specific IT should – for now – be managed as separate but strongly linked workstreams, with a common aim of ensuring transformation across the department. In all cases where departments run digital services, digital should be represented at the same or higher seniority level as technology. The new roles of the Chief Digital Officer (CDO) and Chief Technology Officer (CTO) are for strategic, transformative leadership. CDOs will concentrate on producing digital public services and the wider digital by default strategy. CTOs will concentrate on providing the department-specific IT that supports digital public services and internal users. CTOs will also be in charge of moving their departments to common technology services. Both CDOs and CTOs will need to work out which areas can be commoditised and which need customised services. Both roles need to be getting the most out of new technologies, and will need to structure their teams accordingly. Models, structures and strategies are irrelevant without the right people in the right roles. The best way to restructure senior technology roles will vary across departments according to how much involvement they have across the 4 areas of government technology. In some cases both the CDO and CTO will sit on the board; in other cases they might report into a board level Chief Operating Officer (COO), or only the CDO might be on the board.  Where digital public services rely on department-specific IT systems to support them, a service manager role should be in place, reporting into the CDO with accountability and decision-making authority for the end-to-end service. In all organisations, roles that manage existing contracts, retiring legacy systems, and providing infrastructure services should be subordinate to leadership roles. GDS will provide support by establishing common infrastructure services so senior leaders in departments can concentrate on providing department specific technology for their users. GDS has also established a Recruitment Hub – an advisory service provided to departments to help them recruit talented technology leaders and digital specialists. As part of the Recruitment Hub service, GDS has already begun to work with departments and agencies to help with organisation design. Contact digitaltalent@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk for more information. The CTO/CDO organisational model is not designed to provide a fixed structure for decades to come. It’s a model that reflects the current state of government technology with both large legacy estates and new digital services in development, and is designed to support the changes in technology use over the next 3 to 5 years. Over time the distinction between digital public services and department-specific IT will weaken. As legacy systems are retired and more technology is delivered through the cloud, it will make less sense to draw a separation between the two areas. It’s quite possible that in 5 years’ time both citizens and internal users will use the same digital services and technology. Organisation and governance structures – both within and across departments – will need to develop too. It will be part of the responsibility of senior digital and technology leaders to keep the effectiveness of these structures under review to ensure that they remain fit for purpose.","description":"Government has traditionally treated IT as a single entity with the same approach being used for very different types of service.

Accreditation of government systems is costly, time consuming, and doesn’t help secure them. 3. Open source software is more / less secure than proprietary code. 4. “Product X can’t be used because it isn’t accredited by CESG” 5. Restricted systems need to have bespoke security controls. 6. “I’m not a target for cyber attack!” 7. Impact Levels define security requirements. 8. “I’ve got lots of IL3 records, which aggregate to IL4, so I need to build a confidential back end system” Protecting information from valid threats to its confidentiality, integrity and availability is an enabler of digital services. Without such protection, digital services would be impossible or unsafe. Please note: this guide sets out the governing principles for developing efficiently secured digital services. It also busts some common myths around security. There is another guide about the practical process of security accreditation. Security must be applied intelligently. This means analysing the probable interest in official information from threat sources, establishing their capabilities and methods, and matching proportionate mitigations against these in a traceable manner. Other attempts at security run the risk of over-engineering security controls, or providing an illusion of security by not mitigating the actual risks. Technology alone is never capable of addressing security and privacy risks: there needs to be a risk model that spans technology, people (their behaviours and culture), and processes. Bad user experience arising from over-prescriptive use of technology can lead users to circumvent security controls by employing less secure unofficial IT solutions. Users who then retain the official IT systems suffer degraded productivity. The outcome is that security is not maintained and user experience is unpleasant. However, security and a good user experience do not need to be mutually exclusive. Modern, intelligently designed security can often be made largely transparent to the user, while also providing the enterprise with the confidence it needs that its information is suitably managed. Where some degradation of user experience is unavoidable, a risk management analysis must consider the negative impact of users avoiding unpleasant official IT and degraded productivity. Furthermore, a transparent understanding of the mapping between official information, threat sources and capabilities, through to the required mitigations, enables informed risk management when there is a change in environment or appetite for risk. The vast majority of government’s information will fall into the lowest ‘official tier’. This ‘official tier’ has been created on the basis of a ‘commercial threat model’. This means protection from the type of threats faced by a large company or bank, eg cyber criminals or hacktivists intent on stealing personal or financial information, or disrupting services. To defend against threats such as these, government will use only the very best security technology sourced from the commercial market, and there will be no need for any bespoke or government-only controls at this level. A small set of software will perform security enforcing functions, such as firewalling or encrypting data. Such products require assurance that they function as advertised, achieved through the CESG Commercial Product Assurance (CPA) scheme. This scheme is lightweight compared to previous schemes, reflecting the commercial grade risks for OFFICIAL information. It’s the intention of the Civil Service Reform Plan and the new Security Classification Policy that there’s greater emphasis on user responsibility, reducing expensive and overbearing technical controls. This requires proper training to assist users in handling sensitive information, and auditing to verify users are acting responsibly. Users should be trusted to carry out their roles and given the responsibility to do so securely. Audit and verification of user behaviour should be used to ensure policy compliance instead of preventative measures which add cost and degrade productivity. Such audit and verification should be implemented by services or network infrastructure, away from the end user device. Government should not invest in security controls to protect users from risks they can protect themselves from. Departments should, however, invest in security controls that help defend individual users against threats that they themselves cannot reasonably defend. For example, government should not invest in special technology to prevent civil servants working on sensitive information in an open busy public place; users should be able to judge, assess and use appropriate risk mitigation approaches by themselves. Likewise, civil servants should be able to exercise reasonable judgement about what information is sent to external recipients by email over the public internet. This will lead to reduced technical controls and their associated costs, while also optimising the usability and flexibility of the IT tools for the majority of responsible users. The new security policy provides for a simpler and more meaningful approach to denoting the value of information assets and threat model. Together with a set of common controls for OFFICIAL information, it enables a more consistent, standardised, reusable and interoperable approach to securing information assets in government. There should no longer be situations where information cannot be shared between bodies solely because their interpretation of the same security guidance has led to incompatible controls. The Cabinet Office Security Classification Policy provides guidance as to which information falls into the ‘official’ category. It’s important to start thinking about security from the very start of an IT procurement project, as bolting it on later invariably introduces additional cost and delays. In fact, getting appropriate security into your system needs to start with specifying security requirements correctly in the contract. When we don’t adequately articulate security requirements for design and ongoing maintenance of a system, our suppliers price for the level of contractual risk the ambiguity introduces. Specifying security requirements of the form “must be accreditable for IL3” must become a thing of the past. The risk appetite of departments varies and suppliers not used to working with government will struggle to find out what that means for the design and maintenance of their system – adding cost and risk to both parties. Instead, when writing IT contracts, departments should think about what they care about from an information assurance perspective and specify requirements that actually manage their concerns. As well as getting a solution that address the real business needs, this approach also allows industry to innovate to solve the security problem. It is often said that security is the reason something can’t be done. This is very rarely the case in practice – rather, security is being (mis)used as a handy excuse to not do something. Good information risk management practices allow organisations to understand the risks they are taking with their information assets, and work out the most effective ways to manage and control those risks – while not hindering business. If someone tells you that “Security says No”, or that “CESG say No”, you should ask for more information to learn what the risks actually are, and what techniques and tools are available to help manage those risks. Accreditation effort should always be proportional to the complexity, threat and impact of a system. It is vital that the effort spent should scale to match the challenge at hand. Can the business accept the risks of undertaking a given activity? Accreditation documentation only needs to contain the information needed to enable this decision. Clearly, any accreditation activity which just generates documentation that’s never read is not adding value, nor helping to secure information. When performed well, accreditation helps risk owners have confidence that all aspects of a system’s security have been appropriately considered, and that proper through-life security processes are in place to maintain information security. Experience has shown that the licensing model for software is not an accurate gauge for the security of the finished item. There are very securely developed open source projects and proprietary products. The opposite is also true. The experience and competence of those developing code is of primary importance. The same considerations should be given to the security of open source products as are applied to proprietary code. The Open Source toolkit has more information. There are 3 problems with this statement. Firstly, CESG don’t accredit products – they provide assurance in the security properties of products and certify them when they meet various standards. Secondly, only those products which provide a security enforcing function need to be evaluated and certified by CESG; products like switches or email servers don’t need to be CESG-certified. Finally, CESG certification of a product is a component of risk management – it doesn’t absolve an organisation of their responsibilities to information security. While using certified products should certainly speed up the risk management process, it isn’t mandatory. Restricted systems can be built today using assured commodity security products – many of which are found natively in the operating systems of modern platforms. In the past, some of the security controls which were recommended for protecting Restricted IT systems were bespoke variants of commodity products, or were “government specials”. The requirements which drove these choices are no longer relevant given advances in commodity IT, and better approaches are available to provide an equivalent level of security, but with enhanced usability and overall cost of ownership. Foundation grade assured products are appropriate for the protection of these systems, and commodity security products (including open source) can achieve this grade of certification. Sometimes it’s obvious that attackers are going to be interested in getting hold of your sensitive information – it has clear value to someone. However, immediate financial reward isn’t the only reason government IT systems get attacked. Attackers may be disgruntled insiders, seeking to disrupt or embarrass an organisation. Attacks may come from protest groups, seeking a platform for their views. Or attacks may seek to use one system as a point to launch attacks on another – so you might not be the primary target, but might unwittingly be a conduit to them. Are you specifically being targeted? Maybe not – but your systems and internet presence probably are being attacked on a daily basis for a wide range of reasons. Asking a someone to build an “IL3 system” or to “protect at IL5” is a misuse of the Business Impact Level framework, and will generally cause confusion and an ineffective approach to securing information. Business Impact Levels are intended to help organisations to think about the consequences of certain events, and thus steer where effort should be used when managing information risks. There is no standard set of technical, procedural or personnel controls for any particular Impact Level, and so specifying requirements in terms of Impact Levels is unclear and inaccurate. Instead, security requirements should be defined in terms of the level of protection that each information asset should be given, and expectations around its through-life protection. It’s true that if you are building a system which handles many records, the impact of loss of many of them is likely to be higher than loss of one or two. Although Business Impact Levels are often misused as shorthand for protective markings, there is no direct mapping from Impact Level to protective marking. In the IL3 aggregated to IL4 example, rather than building a system capable of storing confidential records, it’s likely to be acceptable to simply add some simple additional controls around the data store, to reduce the risk of a bulk loss of data.","description":"Protecting information from valid threats to its confidentiality, integrity and availability is an enabler of digital services.

This means that assurance is proactive, ongoing and helps keep the service on track. The governance principles for digital services outline how to keep governance work on track in a similar way. A phase based approach to service development helps to increase the chances of success with in built assurance throughout each stage. Assurance should support delivery (only do something if it adds value) and be proportionate to each phase. Agile, user centred delivery is incremental, with delivery occurring every few weeks. In the early phases, you’ll be creating prototypes, and you’ll be delivering a live service for testing in the later phases. Regular delivery means that: you can test what you’ve produced to see how well it’s meeting user needs — this is the best form of assurance there are regular opportunities to adjust or stop the work as you progress and as the results of testing become known  Visual management is built into Agile approaches. This supports ongoing assurance because progress is visible to anyone. It also means that: People who govern need to go and see things for themselves to judge progress. Doing this regularly is part of assurance — it ensures there won’t be any surprises. This is the best way to understand how user needs are being met and to be reassured that delivery will be successful. At the beginning of a service delivery, you have most to learn. Using a phase based delivery approach significantly reduces risk because: early phases are about experimenting, learning and prototyping to decrease uncertainty about what to build and how to build it there’s an early and continuous focus on meeting user needs — this makes sure the right thing gets built an early focus on investigating major risks and dependencies reduces the chances of them later affecting delivery early phases have bounded time and cost but variable scope — this forces everyone to focus on the most important areas to be investigated  there are opportunities to try out different assurance, reporting and governance approaches and team composition to see what works and what doesn’t before things scale up — this helps set the project up for success It’s also important to assure governance as well as development, particularly early in the life of the service — this is where the pattern of governance is formed and it’s vital to get it right. Agile approaches have a set of processes and ‘assets’ (eg data produced by teams, daily stand up meetings, walls displaying information). You can use these for assurance — there’s no need to ask for anything in addition to this — this just creates extra work and doesn’t add value. When using Agile methods, planning happens: This regular planning gives assurance that: Regular show and tells allow delivery teams to demonstrate their progress. They also allow people who govern to go and see what’s being delivered for themselves. This is another useful form of assurance because they can: Assurers can also see governance in action at show and tells and so assess its effectiveness. Other Agile processes useful for assurance are: When there are multiple teams working on a service — or a set of related services — Agile ways of working support assurance. Activities like cross-team show and tells and the ‘stand up of stand ups’ help multiple teams communicate to make sure dependencies, risks and opportunities are being managed.

Service integration models have been around for some time, but are now evolving from the challenges of managing a small number of large suppliers (typically systems integrators) to a model of managing a greater number of smaller suppliers, often providing commodity services. For the model to be effective the component services need to be well defined and understood. It’s important to avoid any ambiguity about the boundaries of both responsibilities and accountabilities. Key features of an effective model are: The level of service integration will differ depending on the complexity of the business services and/or customers that are being supported, and the complexity of the services that are being delivered to those businesses. As the services and businesses become more critical or complex, the level of service integration becomes deeper.  The design of the service integration function will differ by department. It may be completely operated in-house. Or it might consist of a thin in-house capability ultimately responsible for the integrated end to end operation and management of quality IT services, underpinned by outsourced integration services for specific elements – for example performance monitoring, service desk, or service level reporting. The G-Cloud framework offers a number of services to support service integration. Particularly for smaller departments and simple services, care needs to be taken not to over-engineer the service integration approach – effective use of commodity standards-based IT should mean that integration and support requirements are much less onerous than managing a locked-down bespoke system. As part of service integration, you should maintain an accurate service catalogue including a service dependency map, so that you can effectively manage changes that are high risk, high impact, or that can affect multiple suppliers. When buying in services you should retain the contractual authority to ensure suppliers follow your service integration processes – so that you can ensure the integrity and availability of a department’s user services. This could include an end-to-end service performance incentive model so all suppliers collectively share in the benefits and penalties of a joint performance management regime.","description":"Service integration and management lets an organisation manage the service providers in a consistent and efficient way, making sure that performance across a portfolio of multi-sourced goods and services meets user needs.","link":"/service-manual/technology/service-integration.html"},{"_type":"manual_section","organisations":["government-digital-service"],"manual":"service-manual","title":"Government Service Design Manual: Service management","indexable_content":"Agile and service management ITIL The importance of implementation Other frameworks exist Problematic concepts Further reading Service Strategy Service Design Service Transition Service Operation Continual Service Improvement Functions An example – service transition Projects Business as usual Individuals and interactions over processes and tools Working software over comprehensive documentation Customer collaboration over contract negotiation Responding to change over following a plan IT service management Service portfolio management Financial management for IT services Demand management Business relationship management Design coordination Service Catalogue management Service level management Availability management Capacity Management IT service continuity management Information security management system Supplier management Transition planning and support Change management Service asset and configuration management Release and deployment management Service validation and testing Change evaluation Knowledge management Event management Incident management Request fulfillment Problem management Identity management Service operations Technical management Application management Operations management ISO/IEC 20000 Microsoft Operations Framework Functions in service management ITIL on Wikipedia Introduction to ITIL v3 Discussion of Devops and ITIL Discussion of ITIL and Continuous Delivery    Put in place a sustainable multidisciplinary team that can design, build and operate the service, led by a suitably skilled and senior service manager with decision-making responsibility.

Make sure that you have the capacity and technical flexibility to update and improve the service on a very frequent basis.     continuously update and improve the service on the basis of user feedback, performance data, changes to best practice and service demand  The Digital by Default standard says that organisations should (emphasis on operate added): Put in place a sustainable multidisciplinary team that can design, build and operate the service, led by a suitably skilled and senior service manager with decision-making responsibility. This implies a change to how many organisations have traditionally run services, often with a team or organisation building a service separate from the one running it. This change however does not mean ignoring existing good practice when it comes to service management. The principles of IT service management (ITSM) and those of agile do not necessarily conflict – issues can arise however when organisations implement rigid processes without considering wider service delivery matters, or design and build services without thinking about how they will be operated. The agile manifesto makes the case for: It is too easy to position service management as opposed to agile as traditional service management practices can be viewed as focusing on processes, tools, documentation, planning and contract negotiation – the items on the right hand side of the points above. However, the agile manifesto goes on to say: That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more. To build and run a successful service you will need to work on suitable processes and manage third party relationships. Using existing service management frameworks (especially as a starting point) is one approach to this problem. ITIL (the Information Technology Infrastructure Library) is one such framework. ITIL does a particularly good job of facilitating shared language. For instance it’s definition of a service is: A service is a means of delivering value to customers by facilitating outcomes customers want to achieve. The current version of ITIL currently provides 5 volumes and 26 processes describing in detail various aspects of service management: ITIL also describes four functions that should cooperate together to form an effective service management capability. The above processes and functions make for an excellent high level list of topics to discuss when establishing an operating model for your service, whether or not you adopt the formal methods. In many cases if you have well understood, well established and well documented processes in place for all of the above you should be in a good position to run your service. When looking to combine much of the rest of guidance on the service manual with ITIL or other service management frameworks it is important to challenge existing implementations. This is less about the actual implementation and more often about the problems that implementation was designed to originally solve. As an example ITIL talks a great deal about Service Transition – getting working functionality into the hands of the users of the service. This is a key topic for The Digital Service Standard too which says that teams should: Make sure that you have the capacity and technical flexibility to update and improve the service on a very frequent basis. GOV.UK for instance made more than 100 production releases during its first two weeks after launch. This high rate of change tends to challenge existing processes designed for a slower rate of change. If you are releasing your service every month or every 6 months then a manual process (like a weekly or monthly in-person change approval board or CAB) may be the most suitable approach. If you’re releasing many times a day then the approach to how change is evaluated, tested and managed tends towards being more automated. This moves effort from occasional but manual activities to upfront design and automation work. More work is put in to assure the processes rather than putting all the effort into assuring a specific transition. Service management frameworks tend to acknowledge this, for instance ITIL has a concept of a standard change (something commonly done, with known risks and hence pre-approved), but a specific implementation in a given organisation might not. It is important to note that other service management frameworks and standards exist, including some that are of a similar size and scope to ITIL: Many organisations also use smaller processes and integrate them together. The needs of your service and organisation will determine what works best for you. Some traditional language tends to cause some confusion when discussing service management alongside agile. It’s generally best to avoid the following terms when possible, although given their widespread usage this isn’t always possible. It is however worth being aware of the problems these concepts raise. Projects tend to imply a start and an end. The main goal of project work is to complete it, to reach the end. Especially for software development the project can too often be viewed as done when the software is released. What happens after that is another problem entirely – and often someone else’s problem. However when building services the main goal is to meet user needs. These needs may change over time, and are only met by software that is running in production and available to those users. This doesn’t mean not breaking work down into easily understandable parts, but stories, sprints and epics are much more suited to agile service delivery. The concept of business as usual also clashes with a model of continuous service improvement. It immediately brings to mind before and after states, often with the assumption that change is both much slower and more constrained during business as usual. In reality, until you put your service in the hands of real users as part of an alpha or beta you won’t have all the information needed to build the correct service. And even once you pass the live standard you will be expected to: continuously update and improve the service on the basis of user feedback, performance data, changes to best practice and service demand","description":"The Digital by Default standard\nsays that organisations should (emphasis on operate added):","link":"/service-manual/operations/service-management.html"},{"_type":"manual_section","organisations":["government-digital-service"],"manual":"service-manual","title":"Government Service Design Manual: Service manager induction programme","indexable_content":"Who should take part What’s covered Request a place Why are we here?

However, in many cases it is likely that the service manager won’t have the capacity to be this hands-on, so they are likely to need a dedicated product manager.

At the point of launch it should look like GOV.UK and should have the GOV.UK logotype, including the crown. You can still follow the guidance if your service isn’t on GOV.UK, but your site shouldn’t identify as being part of GOV.UK and shouldn’t use the crown or the GOV.UK logotype in the header. This blog post talks about a good example of a site that follows our design patterns without using the logo. Services should use clear, easy to read type, with consistent styles and a clear hierarchy of information. You’ll be given access to the New Transport typeface if your service is on GOV.UK. The GOV.UK elements page has more information about typography. In most cases your service will not need to use pictures. You should only use icons if they are clear, simple and help to convey information more clearly than text alone could. You should use the standard template for your header and footer if your service is on GOV.UK.

Work with your service team to experiment and learn to see what works and what doesn’t just as you’d experiment and learn about the service during these early phases. It’s best to start by erring on the side of too little reporting rather than too much – you’ll quickly find out what you’re missing – and to focus on visual and face-to-face reporting, using team walls and show and tells. Remember to only do it if it adds value. You should provide timely, constructive feedback to delivery teams on what they need – this helps them to improve their reporting. Good reporting from teams will help you make decisions and give feedback when it’s needed. Service teams should work with you to understand what reporting you need. Make sure any reporting is really necessary and don’t impose too many requirements. If you do, it will be counter-productive because it means less time spent on delivery work. This is especially important as you transition between one phase and another – you don’t want the team to lose momentum.  Teams should set up reporting in a way that won’t cause any extra work. This includes: This reporting should provide all the information that’s needed for good governance.  The GOV.UK team uses the data on its team wall to create a report for people who cannot visit the wall. Everyone should feel comfortable and welcome to view a team wall at any point. This will support a culture of transparency in your organisation and make sure any problems can be discussed and solved openly. Delivery teams need flexibility in how they work in order to be effective, but you might be working with a number of services, and some consistency in how delivery teams provide information can help you govern well. Teams should: Some consistency in reporting means you can more effectively:  Don’t try and force more consistency than this because the circumstances of each team will be so different.

When building services around patterns and consistency, it’s important to share your frontend assets so that they can be easily reused as required. There are two more benefits to this approach: The templates on GOV.UK are constantly changing as we react to user feedback and evolving best practice, so the best place to find them is by looking at the code we publish: The GOV.UK template is a project that provides the GOV.UK header and footer, as well as associated assets. It generates a variety of output formats and you can extend it with more depending on the language your service is written in. GOV.UK’s static consumes the Ruby version of the template application, which in turn provides shared resources like footer links across the various frontend apps that run GOV.UK. The Performance Platform’s Node.js application uses the Mustache version of the template. You should be able to become a consumer of the template in exactly the same way these two projects are, by adding it to your application’s dependencies. The service manual article on Sass repositories has more information on this repository. GDS is continuously improving GOV.UK, which means that template and asset code changes regularly. All services on GOV.UK are expected to keep their templates and assets updated. How you do this will depend on how your frontend is implemented, but if you include the template and the toolkit as dependencies in your application it should be relatively easy to update as GDS publishes new versions. Please contact the GDS team for help or advice.","description":"Shared asset libraries are helpful for using the same frontend and\nbranding on multiple services.","link":"/service-manual/user-centred-design/resources/shared-asset-libraries.html"},{"_type":"manual_section","organisations":["government-digital-service"],"manual":"service-manual","title":"Government Service Design Manual: Spending controls","indexable_content":"The process What will be examined Further information on the process advertising, marketing and communications strategic supplier management, including disputes commercial models ICT Digital Service Delivery (including GOV.UK Verify) external recruitment consultancy redundancy and compensation learning and development property and facilities management greater public and market transparency and two-way engagement through publishing business needs and subsequent decisions towards a solution greater emphasis on problem exploration, solution discovery and market engagement activity before any formal procurement is initiated greater use of agile iterative development over linear waterfall delivery contracts (including contract amendments, extensions or renewals) licences expenditure through existing frameworks feasibility and/or proof of concept studies pilots projects (or an element of a project) and programmes ‘business as usual’ changes or enhancements or maintenance or refreshes common infrastructure solutions including voice and data communications, Public Services Networks (PSN) whether fixed or mobile. Organisations should follow the rules set out in Managing public money which explains the overriding principles for dealing with resources used by public sector organisations in the UK. The government’s Spend Controls supplement those rules with specific controls for spend in: A request for spend approval is likely to require a number of controls – most digital and IT spend requests will also require commercial approval to make sure they are aligned to government procurement policy. Each department has a GDS senior IT adviser who will ensure that other areas of Cabinet Office are engaged as needed when considering a case. An online controls tool has been introduced to support this process and give full visibility on case progress. The purpose of the IT and digital controls is to ensure that spending on IT is proportionate and directed at programmes and projects that meet the commonly agreed digital and ICT strategies. It’s an independent confirmation that the department has undertaken thorough consideration of the user need and value for money solution options. The controls process has changed over time to ensure: GDS will examine and challenge all technology-related spending over a certain threshold – no public commitment or expenditure should be made above these thresholds without prior approval. The thresholds are set out in our technology code of practice: These thresholds cover all technology expenditure, including: They also cover programmes that are broken into smaller chunks or projects, which individually are below the thresholds, but which in aggregate are above them.  Digital is defined as any external-facing service provided through the internet to citizens, businesses, civil society or non-government organisations.  This includes, but is not limited to information services, websites, transactional services, web applications, mobile apps, and extranets. The control covers the total cost of running that service, including any assisted digital element such as support provided through face to face, phone, third party intermediary or other channels to access the digital service. The definition of digital does not include content creation on existing sites, intranets or those areas listed under the advertising, marketing and communications controls. Users should refer to Cabinet Office controls guidance, specifically the digital and technology section (PDF). Departments should engage early with GDS to agree the appropriate points for approval, before the first approval is needed (usually after the discovery phase, at strategic outline case or before a prior information notice is issued).  This early engagement will avoid departments proceeding too far without approval and reduces the risk of irregular expenditure. Full details of current requirements are detailed in the Cabinet Office ICT Spend Control Form.  You can start the process by e-mailing gdsapprovals@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk. If your request contains ‘Restricted’ information it should be sent to gdsapprovals@govdigital.gsi.gov.uk. Note that your organisation may have established a single point of contact for engaging with GDS, so check first within your organisation. If your project cost exceeds your department’s main delegated authority set by Treasury it will be classed as a major project. GDS and HMT have released a guidance clarification explaining how agile approval can be streamlined in these cases. You will still need to engage with the Major Projects Authority (MPA). HMT’s ‘Major Project approval and assurance guidance’ (PDF) describes the Treasury’s and the MPA’s process.

(please provide supporting evidence, eg analytics data that shows proportion of visitors to your content/service that currently access it using relevant devices) Tom Loosemoore’s blog post about standalone apps    “Standalone mobile apps will only be considered once the core web service works well on mobile devices, and if specifically agreed with the Cabinet Office”  The government’s position is that native apps are currently rarely justified. At the October 2012 Digital Leaders meeting, the position was clarified: native apps could not be developed without Cabinet Office approval. The November 2012 Digital Strategy says: “Standalone mobile apps will only be considered once the core web service works well on mobile devices, and if specifically agreed with the Cabinet Office” Making sure your service meets the Digital by Default Service Standard means it will work well on mobile devices. Making your data and application programming interface (API) available for reuse will stimulate the market if there is real demand for native apps. So-called ‘apps’ come in several different forms, which makes confusion understandable. When people are talking about ‘apps’, they can mean: Native apps are downloadable software applications that run using the device’s operating system code and APIs. Native apps remain on the device and can access all the hardware features (camera, storage, phone capabilities etc). Because they run using native code, different versions must be created for each operating system. Examples of native apps include Spotify, Angry Birds, Instagram, and Skype. Pros of native apps: Cons of native apps: Responsive web design is a design approach that optimises users’ viewing experiences across a wide range of devices. When a responsive website is accessed via a mobile phone, it’s sometimes referred to as a ‘mobile web app’. Responsive websites are built using open web standards (HTML, CSS, JavaScript etc) and they run inside a device’s web browser. Examples include GOV.UK, PM’s dashboard, Financial Times app, and BBC Sport. Pros of responsive web design: Cons of responsive web design: If there’s a market for native apps, why should government monopolise it? There’s a vibrant market of third party native app developers using government data and APIs. The government’s position is that native and hybrid apps are currently rarely justified. GDS back open standards – this removes the risk of having to create different, yet similar, versions of a service so an app is compatible with new devices that enter the market. While people spend as much time using apps as using mobile web, the vast majority of app use is for gaming and social networking. For ‘utility’ needs, such as those met by government services, the mobile web is preferred to native apps. GDS recognise that there’ll be a few exceptions. To help you assess whether your case is likely to be considered an exception, consider if you’ve met the following conditions: If these conditions are not in place, it’s unlikely that your app proposal will be approved. If you believe there are compelling reasons why these conditions have not been met, please set them out in your proposal. In your proposal, please provide answers and evidence on the following: In addition to the evidence requested above, all digital spend for the development of standalone mobile apps is subject to the GDS spend approval. Guidance (including details about response times) on the process can be found on GOV.UK. If you have any queries, please contact GDS.","description":"The government’s position is that native apps are currently rarely justified.

In order to increase the effectiveness of the survey, it is important to include an introduction that explains the purpose of the survey to potential respondents. Make it clear what the survey will be used for, and how it will help improve the service. As it’s unlikely that it will be possible to include monetary incentives, it’s important the introduction is worded in a manner that increases the likelihood that people will want to take part. It is also recommended that people are informed of how long the survey will take to complete as this will reduce drop out rate (people who start the survey but don’t finish). Screener questions should be placed at the beginning of surveys to ensure that the correct people take the survey eg demographic information, reason for visiting etc. Quotas may also be set so that you can control the number of people taking the survey that fall into a specific demographic group or audience type. A typical user survey will be structured in the following manner: Surveys are normally composed of the following types of questions: Single response (these type of questions allow the respondent to select just one answer) eg: Q.

It’s important to recognise you are testing in the first place to: Too often the aim of testing is to validate what has been produced and nothing else. Your testing should be more about these 7 concepts: Use the vast majority of your efforts building quality in at the start, and test the quality throughout the project – not at the end when it’s too late. Define acceptance criteria standards for your user stories. You can either do this when you first write your user stories or later on in the form of acceptance tests when you start development work. Testing should confirm what you already know and understand to be true, so there should be no surprises in the latter stages. Service quality isn’t just a testing issue. The quality of a system is defined by the people who create it. Your team should be able to see a problem in the quality of your system. Every person on the project should be taking action to increase quality and fix issues. A successful agile project relies on fast feedback loops. Getting feedback and getting it fast means you can actually be agile and change when you need to change. Your testing should be about giving and getting that fast feedback – at a time when it’s useful. Automated code testing techniques have their place and you can use them, but don’t make them the centre of your approach to testing. When you build a test, build it to a standard that makes it suitable to use for testing multiple times throughout your project. It takes a lot of effort to do testing correctly, so don’t make it a throwaway exercise that has to start from scratch each time there’s a new release, or a new project. Write your automated tests with the same care and accuracy as production code. Testing is necessary and valuable to the programme, but the time it takes for your code to go live once written is time wasted. Use testing to get the fastest possible confirmation that everything is as you expect – or that it isn’t and needs to be fixed. It doesn’t always need to be exhaustive at every level, but it does need to be relevant to the current situation. Your team needs to agree on the necessary testing at each level, based on the preferences of the product owner and the likelihood of risk in the application itself. Everybody in your programme needs to understand and agree on: When done well, testing will inform you of the best way forward. It’ll also give you the best value in terms of effort used in various functional or nonfunctional areas and will: The most noticeable difference with testing in an agile project is that the majority of your test efforts will be centred on automated tests.  These tests run in continuous integration, which means that they form part of your codebase – every time you make a change to your code, your tests are automatically run. You’ll get immediate feedback on the quality of your code and it’ll help to prevent bugs happening at a later stage (when they’re expensive and complicated to resolve.) Read the guidance about testing code. Read the guidance about exploratory testing. Read the guidance about load and performance testing Read the guidance about penetration testing Read the guidance about accessibility testing Crowdsourced testing doesn’t use a set group of people to carry out testing (known as outsource testing). It uses different people from different places in different jobs. It’s a good way of speeding up your manual testing and/or covering more ground. There are external companies who provide this as a service, but GDS do it internally by: Examples of where GDS used this effectively include: Don’t forget, don’t just test the product itself – test your ideas.

These are only interpretations and there is no one way of doing it. At GDS, we are framework- and methodology-agnostic. We take the tools that we need to from a range of techniques and use the most appropriate for the project and team to help support them to deliver. This means that not all teams will be working in exactly the same way. These are the four categories of people that might want to learn more about agile, the content in the more detailed sections below is repeated where it is relevant to multiple categories of people: Agile delivery practitioner (and those wanting to be) These people need to use agile every day and help teach others. Typical roles are: Delivery team members: if you are becoming part of a delivery team This covers any other people who’ll be part of an agile team, eg: People who govern and stakeholders: if you are going to be a member of a governance team or a stakeholder for an agile project These people are senior responsible officers (SROs), project leads, directors and those responsible for supporting an agile project. Typical roles are: Interested others: if you are just interested in finding out more This covers anyone that has an interest in understanding what it means to work in an agile way. Formal training is only one part of learning, as with most new skills. With agile delivery management in particular, training will only give you the foundations of some of the techniques, but the real learning comes from doing. It’s important that the organisational culture is set up to support learning and experimenting. Think about ways to start getting hands on experience as quickly as possible. This can come through: Shadowing / learning from others You can learn a lot from seeing others who are practicing agile techniques. Because teams are open and transparent, they should be happy to invite you into planning, review and retrospective sessions. You should also try to spend some time shadowing or working with delivery practitioners on problems to give you a better understanding of how they apply agile. Try to invite external speakers in to share their own experiences with you and your department and take the chance to discuss your ideas with them. Formal training Training courses are useful to help understand theory, but it’s important to remember that there is no one answer to how to run every project and that training does not equal learning. It’s worthwhile to learn a number of tools and techniques and strengthen your understanding with self-initiated learning and doing. Some options to think about when training are: Refer to the Civil Service Learning portal to book formal classroom training as a civil servant Self-initiated learning (networking, reading blogs) You can teach yourself through self-initiated learning, networking and reading books and blogs.  The first thing you should read is the agile section of the Service Design Manual. Networking is a useful way of learning. You can also find local meetups and events close to you at www.meetup.com or you could start your own. There are hundreds of blogs about agile and lean techniques with lots to learn. Subscribe to ones that you think are interesting. GDS also has an agile delivery community links list that’s updated regularly, which you can subscribe to. It’s also worth having a look to see if there are any relevant collections on the links collection service paper.li as well as other web collections of links. Sharing ideas and support (community, blogging, public speaking) Once you’re confident, teaching others is a good way to learn. Try engaging in communities like those on LinkedIn, blogging on your own and others’ blogs about agile or speaking about your experiences internally, at meetups or events. Small experiments and running short projects The best learning can come from doing. Agile techniques can be applied to many types of projects and are not restricted to software. This means that you can quickly start to learn as a team through running small projects. Take a project that you’re working on and start to apply agile techniques to it, then improve on them as you go. You can learn a lot from being unsuccessful: the phrase “fail fast” is often used in an agile context, but what you can benefit from is learning quickly. Questioning and retrospecting You’ll learn a lot through asking questions and there is an agile tool that helps you to do this – the retrospective. This is an important part of any agile team and a good way of learning – everyone has an input. Regular retrospectives are great way to understand what works and what doesn’t, so you can think about how your learning can be directed. Pairing / Learning from others Pairing comes from the term pair programming in Extreme programming, but is just as relevant to different types of work. During this practice two people will sit together to work on the same thing at the same time. One of you is writing the code or doing the task, and the other is observing and giving input. The benefits of working in this way lead to better quality of code, better communication amongst the team and learning how something is built and why decisions were made. Pairing will rapidly increase learning as an individual and as a team. Formal training Training courses are useful to help understand theory, but it’s important to remember that there is no one answer to how to run every project and that training does not equal learning. It’s worthwhile to learn a number of tools and techniques and strengthen your understanding with self-initiated learning and doing. Some options to think about when training are: Refer to the Civil Service Learning portal to book formal classroom training as a civil servant Self-initiated learning (networking, reading blogs) You can teach yourself through self-initiated learning, networking and reading books and blogs.

This is one of the advantages of shifting services online, people can transact with you when it suits them, not just when your office or call centre is open. But achieving good uptime for a service takes planning and good design. It is important to build services that wherever possible can be turned off (or fail) gracefully. The possible states for a service should not be limited to on or off. Individual components could be designed to fall back to minimal functions. A read-only mode could be introduced where information can be looked at but not changed. If your service is reliant on a third-party service, you could queue information for later processing if that service were to become unavailable. Remember to build in redundancy and avoid single points of failure. You can avoid the problem of a web server failing by having more than one and load-balancing between them, or minimise disruption if a database crashes by using database systems which spread data and queries across a cluster. A critical part of maintaining a service is the people running it day-to-day. People may be involved in responding to customer issues or in more technical activities like resolving minor outages before they cause a real problem. Don’t forget that people will be using your service when you’re not at work. Failures during out-of-hours periods can go unnoticed for long periods of time if no-one is responsible for them. Make sure you consider evenings and weekends and also whether an on-call system is appropriate, or whether you need a dedicated 24/7 support capability. Ultimately you may make trade-offs, eg sacrificing certainty around uptime for lower cost. Try to do this openly and communicate decisions made. Many problems regarding uptime come from mismanaged expectations. Remember the availability of the service is dependent on the availability of lots of systems, potentially across multiple suppliers not all of whom you have a direct relationship with. Maybe your application (maintained by your development team) relies on an application server or database (provided by another team in your department) which runs on an Infrastructure as a Service platform (provided via contract with a commercial supplier) which relies on network connectivity and power from utilities (which you have no direct contract with). This can become quite complex in a service-oriented architecture where you rely on other software applications and interfaces. Understand your dependencies and understand their dependencies and all the intended uptime expectations. Sometimes uptime can be quoted to ignore pre-arranged maintenance periods. So for example a service may claim 100% even though it shuts down every Monday evening for maintenance. Hiding uptime problems behind lots of maintenance periods should be avoided. However, it may be fine to quote both planned and unplanned downtime where services genuinely do need scheduled maintenance. Some suppliers will offer recompense for missing uptime guarantees or service level agreement response times. Although this can obviously be useful consider whether the money or service credits offered really offset the difficulties faced by people using the service. If you’re regularly getting credits for uptime problems consider whether you are really getting the offered uptime or SLA from your supplier. The impact that contracts with suppliers (of products or services) can have on availability should not be underestimated. Comprehensive guidance on contracts is out of the scope of this guide but ensure contract terms, service level agreements and uptime guarantees and understood by the team responsible for the service. And that at the very least the service manager is involved with contracts for underlying systems.","description":"The expectation when using an online service is that it’s available 24\nhours a day 365 days a year.

Do it continuously through each stage — don’t leave it as something that happens at the beginning and end of phases. Doing user research continuously will: Each team needs to have a designer and a researcher working together, both having an active interest in the design and user insight. This isn’t about a user researcher ‘testing’ the work of the designer — having designers and researchers work together means that: Make sure that you have a team member leading on research that sits with the team. They may also do other work (design, write content etc), but are also responsible for running research at least every 2 weeks. Don’t spend more than 2 weeks working on design without testing it with real end users. Each 2-week iteration should comprise of 3 stages:  With every iteration, create materials to be included in the next round of research. In the alpha and beta phases, these will typically be prototypes that vary in accuracy — from paper prototypes through to working prototypes in code. Use existing GDS code and other open source frameworks as: Accept that you’ll design and build a number of prototypes to test with end users, and that these prototypes will be thrown away. This gives the team freedom to explore a range of different concepts and gain a better understanding of what works best for end users. Allow time for these experiments particularly in the early stages of the project. In the early stages of your project the prototype will probably look unfinished and the design will still require a lot of work. Stick to the ‘test every 2 weeks’ rule, instead of waiting until you’re completely happy with the design or have something that feels finished. Try to make sure that the prototype is completed at least 24 hours before your testing sessions begin, as it: There are many ways to create ‘experiments’ that will help you to answer questions about your product, your end users and your design ideas. Your researcher will help choose the best research methods for answering each question. With their help, you’ll probably end up using a number of different techniques on your project. Whatever your project, be sure to do fortnightly user research. In these sessions you’re able to: Carry out research sessions with users every 2 weeks on the same day. Doing user testing at predictable and regular intervals means that your team members will be able to schedule time to watch sessions. A good approach is to schedule 5 one-on-one interviews for that day, each interview being 1 hour in duration. (Schedule a 6th participant as a ‘spare’ in case some participants don’t attend earlier in the day or you have a poorly recruited participant). Conduct these sessions in either: Make sure that you have both facilities booked and participants recruited as early in your project as possible for the expected duration of the alpha and beta phases. To prepare for these sessions, you need to: Prepare your prototype for the sessions by making sure that it’s: In each user testing session: A day of research should be followed by a period of analysis before making any significant design changes. The analysis stage is described in detail below. You can use the time between more formal testing to conduct some guerrilla-style testing, getting some initial feedback on your revised designs. Guerrilla testing normally involves taking your prototype into a coffee shop or other public location and finding volunteers who’ll give you some quick feedback. Guerrilla testing participants aren’t necessarily representative of your target audience, but they can provide a quick sense-check in between formal testing sessions. There are many other research methods you can use to supplement your ‘in person’ qualitative research and to address specific research questions. Using a different technique can provide better insight into a particular research question, or validate insights from fortnightly research with a larger audience. Here‘s a list of some techniques you can use and information on how and when you should use them. Now it’s time to see what you can learn from your user testing and research. Make the best possible use of this information by: It’s important to properly debrief after spending a day doing user testing as you’ll have seen a lot of people and a lot of different reactions. Although it takes time to analyse sessions in detail, doing so means that you’ll: To do this correctly, you need to: At this stage you’re aiming to create a full set of insights (things that you’ve observed and learned), so don’t start designing solutions just yet. You should allow several hours for this analysis process. Work with anyone that’s seen the user testing session to analyse observations, as it will help to:  Decide what you’re going to do about each finding, if anything, and when you’ve proven a theory, make sure that it’s recorded and shared with the project team. If a finding needs further action, determine what is required to address it in the next design iteration. Write this on an orange post-it note and stick it on top of the finding. When you’ve decided on what actions to take, use a prioritisation method (like dot voting) to decide how you’ll spend your efforts for the next iteration. Put user testing findings and actions in a place that’s easily accessible to the project team, as it’s likely that you’ll come back to the findings to: You can document your findings for others to see in many different ways, like using a: It’s also useful to keep a record of what you tested with users, eg if you’ve prototyped in code, keep a folder in your repository for each round. You may also like to keep screenshots of the prototype. GDS intend to create a format for sharing research findings between projects across government. While GDS work on the best way to do this, keep your research findings in an accessible shared format so findings can be shared and learned from in the future. The findings should, wherever possible, be easily understood with no need for an explanation. Move any actions onto your story wall so that the whole team can see what you’re working on and who’s working on it. Use videos to demonstrate findings and store the session videos in a safe place, ideally where they can be found and watched by team members. If you store the videos on a public service (like Vimeo), make sure they are adequately protected. You need to discuss the project and its progress with others. You can do this by: Just as a product team often presents a showcase at the end of each iteration, so should the research and design team. This will make sure the wider project team has an understanding of: This is an opportunity for members of the project team to catch up if they haven’t been able to attend user testing sessions, as well as an opportunity to ask questions. Depending on how your team works, you might put your presentation into the project team’s showcase or you may have a showcase just for research and design. There may be other people beyond your more immediate project team who are interested in the outcomes of your work. You can communicate and/or work together with these people by: Make it possible for your team to always access the latest version of the prototype, but make sure it’s appropriately protected. Team members may need to check something or use the prototype to talk about the project with their own stakeholders. Put a message across the top of the prototype to remind people that it’s a work in progress. It’s important to reflect on your progress at regular intervals. Schedule a retrospective where research and design team members have the chance to discuss the process openly and can suggest changes to the process. Assign owners and due dates to the actions to make sure that change occurs.","description":"Carry out user research during every stage of your project.

Users’ information needs and analytics Using search data to meet user needs Exploring user needs What we know about the users of Inside Government Meeting the needs of businesses Introducing the Needotron: working out the shape of the product Deep understanding of your users’ needs is crucial for building a successful digital service. Any thinking about a service, whether online or offline, must start with the question: what is the user need? Defining a user need must be strict and honest. For GDS, it’s the need the user has of government, not the need of government to impart information to the user. That’s an important distinction, because it means that you’ll be able to more accurately measure the success of your services and iteratively improve them to meet the needs of the people who’ll make use of them. You should be able to provide evidence that a user need actually exists, and starting from the potential evidence areas can be a good way to start creating a list of user needs. Good evidence points can include: The way you describe each user need can have a big impact on how successfully you ultimately meet the real need of the user. Especially for your most important user needs it’s important to make sure you have framed the need correctly – that is, described it using words that actually reflect what the user’s trying to do and aren’t just loosely describing the kind of content you think they might need. For example, when thinking about tax codes, consider the solution you might design for this user need: ‘as a user I want information about how tax codes are calculated’. Now consider the solution you might design for this user need: ‘as a user I want to know if I’m on the right tax code’.  It can be difficult to get the framing right from analytics data alone. Especially for your most important user needs, be sure to do some qualitative research (talking directly to users) and talk to frontline staff to make sure the wording properly reflects the real user need. You need to set the boundaries of what your service can and should offer to prevent a bottomless list of user needs. This is especially true of a government website like GOV.UK. As well as identifying user needs, we identified which of those needs the government must answer. This led to the ‘It’s in if…’ criteria: Similar criteria may help you determine which needs you build a service to meet. Expressing a user need mustn’t imply the solution. The user need should be expressed as a user story, so the service team can discuss and explore possible solutions.

Surveys can be conducted either face to face by a trained moderator or through self-completion (online, postal etc) in order to quantify thoughts/beliefs, behaviours, ownership etc. Surveys can be a relatively cheap and quick way of gathering and quantifying public opinion and monitoring change over time. Surveys can be used to size a market to find out how many people own a product, or take part in an activity eg how many people use the Internet in the UK. They can be also used to understand usage and attitudes towards a product or activity eg how often people use the Internet, how they access it, why the use it etc. Complex analysis can be also be conducted to understand key drivers of attitude/behaviour, segmentation of audiences, and trade offs between different opinions etc. Surveys provide a snapshot of opinion, and are a useful method for monitoring uptake, usage and attitudes over time. Self-completion surveys used to obtain information from web users. Surveys are activated when a user interacts with a page – this can either be through arriving/leaving a page, or clicking on a link. Software is used to control the  proportion of users who are invited to take a specific survey. In order to increase completion rates, online surveys are normally no longer than 5 to 10 minutes in length (approximately 20 to 25 questions). These are identical in set up and design to online web surveys, except participants are asked to complete them via an email, and not at random when they visit a website. Email surveys are often more targeted as participants can be identified by information already known about the them eg demographic, information usage etc. Online or email surveys are normally the cheapest method as these can be conducted in-house using inexpensive or free survey software, inviting people to take part from their own website, or using a database of email addresses. Like telephone interviews, face to face interviews are structured and conducted by a trained moderator. Unlike other survey methods, respondents may be shown limited stimulus – eg an advert, a leaflet cover or a website design. Face to face interviews also enable researchers to target respondents more easily by demographic, geographic and socio-economic group. Structured interviews that are conducted over the phone by a trained moderator. Telephone and face interviews are the most costly methodology and they are normally conducted by a third party agency. Although surveys can be a quick and cheap manner in which to conduct user research, they often: All surveys, regardless of methodology, should use a robust sample that is nationally representative or representative of an audience of interest. Most nationally representative surveys are 1,000 people or more, but can be significantly larger if there are a number of distinct user groups that are being targeted. It is important that the delivery channel used considers the target audience. For example in the recent Digital Landscape research an online and face-to-face methodology was used as both online and offline audiences needed to be interviewed – an online only methodology would have excluded those who are offline, and the opinions of this audience omitted from the research. It is also important to note that performing research with hard-to-reach groups can be more time consuming and costly (eg black and minority ethnic, people with disabilities).","description":"Surveys contain closed ended questions with fixed responses such as ‘yes’, ‘no’, ‘very satisfied’ to ‘very dissatisfied’, ‘excellent’ to ‘poor’ etc, and open ended questions that allow respondents to provide written responses.","link":"/service-manual/user-centred-design/user-research/user-research-surveys.html"},{"_type":"manual_section","organisations":["government-digital-service"],"manual":"service-manual","title":"Government Service Design Manual: User research tools","indexable_content":"Survey tools Remote user testing tools Card sorting tools Online focus groups Community groups Text analysis tool    Please note: Examples are illustrative, rather than recommendations, and we suggest checking G-Cloud regularly to see if any similar services are available using that framework.

Below is a high level overview of what these enable, for people unfamiliar with user testing.","link":"/service-manual/user-centred-design/user-research/user-research-tools.html"},{"_type":"manual_section","organisations":["government-digital-service"],"manual":"service-manual","title":"Government Service Design Manual: User research skills","indexable_content":"How user researchers work How to hire researchers Job description templates Further reading Really understanding who your users are, understanding their needs and maintaining a close focus on designing digital services that best meet their needs is an ongoing struggle again our internal processes and domain knowledge. Regular user research helps to make sure that we start and stay aligned with real user needs. User researchers are involved at all phases of the project and work closely and collaboratively with designers and product owners. In the early stages of discovery they assist in developing a clear understanding and empathy for end users, making sense of existing research and commissioning or conducting additional research. Through the Alpha and Beta phases they work closely with the design team to provide guidance based on their understanding of end user needs and behaviour, and working with the team to design methods to answer outstanding questions about the users and the design of the service being created. As a member of the delivery team, you should hire researchers who are comfortable working in an agile team, delivering continuous research in fortnightly iterations. Especially in alpha and beta phases, you will get better results by bringing a researcher into your team rather than outsourcing research to 3rd party. In particular you should look for a researcher who has experience contributing to other disciplines in the team. Capabilities in design or content are particularly helpful. In product development a mixture of experience in both qualitative and quantitative research is useful, although the most essential will be the ability to design and conduct qualitative research. Teams should aim to observe real users interacting with the product they are designing at least every two weeks, most often in the form of one-on-one interviews. When hiring a user researcher there are two main things to consider. Firstly consider whether they have sufficient experience in designing, facilitating and analysing user research, in particular one-on-one interviews and usability testing. A researcher with hours of experience observing end users interacting with digital products can bring value to the design team immediately. Most experienced researchers should be able to provide you with an estimate of their total hours of experience observing users and, on request, provide video clips showing examples of their facilitation techniques for you to review. You are looking for a researcher who has 100+ hours of facilitation experience and who demonstrates an empathetic yet methodical approach to facilitation. Secondly, consider their ability to work well in an agile team. This means that they need to be able to work collaboratively with designers and product owners, to be flexible and responsive in designing research and comfortable with a fast moving work environment where change is constant, and most importantly, they need to have experience and ability in quickly and effectively communicating research insights in an actionable way so that these insights actively shape the design and development of the product. This will usually mean that the researcher has exercised some creativity and experimentation in their method of communicating findings and they should be able to share examples that were more and less successful.

User satisfaction helps you to measure the overall quality of the service experience. Many government transactions are mandatory for users, so they’re not naturally enjoyable, and are sometimes referred to as grudge transactions. Still, try to make them as pleasant as possible for users, who may be nervous or stressed when interacting with the government. Asking users how satisfied they are with a service can provide you with a measure of all the parts that contribute to the overall user experience, like ease of use, navigation and design. Define user satisfaction as the percentage of people who answered either “very satisfied” or “satisfied” on a 5-point scale in response to this question: Q: Overall, how satisfied were you with this [eg car tax] service today? GOV.UK will provide a user satisfaction survey at the end of your transactional service and make this data available. Measure all user journeys through your transaction to better understand dropout points. If a user drops out you should try and collect some data around the quality of your service to explain why they didn’t complete the transaction. For example,‘please tell us why are you unable to complete this transaction.’ Although this survey will not be contribute to the overall measure of user satisfaction it will help you understand service dropout points and find ways to improve transactions. To successfully measure the user satisfaction of your service, we recommend that you measure through all stages of your service. During the discovery phase you should: Benchmark user satisfaction via remote usability testing and/or a satisfaction survey. During your beta phase: Once your service is live you should: An exit survey will be run continuously on your service, and will report on user satisfaction on a monthly basis. You can use this data to improve your service. Analyse the major factors generating satisfaction with the service. You can do this by asking additional questions (eg on ease of use, accuracy, look and feel). You can then determine which of those factors is most positively contributing to user satisfaction and prioritise where to direct ongoing design efforts.

We recommend that you: Using email addresses as usernames has a number of advantages, but make sure you thoroughly research the users of your service before making it the only option or you may end up excluding people. Find out more about asking for an email address Use this option for services with a social element or in combination with the email option. You can have the service create a username for people from a reference number or similar. Only use this option for infrequent, short term interactions like checking the status of a transaction. Some people will wish to change their username. For example if it’s an email address that’s no longer available for them or it reflects a name that they no longer use. If people will be signing in to your service more than once or twice you should let them change their username or make it easy to migrate to a new account. Make sure you think through the consequences of people doing this.

A process of continual iteration and close measurement will help you to see what needs improvement and how to investigate ways of improving your service.  Make sure the core key performance indicators (KPIs) established in the service standard, and any other KPIs you choose to measure, accurately reflect the needs of your users and stakeholders. This will allow you to measure the ability of your service to meet user needs. While building your service, make sure that appropriate analytics tools are being used to monitor the service, collecting the data necessary to produce accurate and timely measurements. For more information, read our guidance on choosing analytics tools. Establish a ‘baseline’ based on the current performance trends of each channel. Use this to judge the effectiveness of any changes to your service. This will help you pinpoint the effectiveness of your initiatives, and identify what worked. Look at performance trends over time, rather than taking a snapshot at a particular point. Peaks and dips in performance can then be measured in relation to this base (or trend) line, which helps to: Collect and combine performance information from multiple sources and across multiple channels. Make sure you understand what this will mean in terms of system requirements. Combining data often reveals useful insights, eg into service efficiency (cost per transaction and total cost to serve) or the amount of usage by channel (percentage digital take-up vs post, phone etc). Communicate performance information to your users through the appropriate: Highlight specific segments that you know users are interested in, and make sure that your visualisations are simple, useful and contain minimal amounts of chartjunk. Typical segments include: By making your visualisations easy to understand you significantly increase the likelihood that the information will be used to improve your service. Best practices include: Any service that meets user needs will include an element of user feedback. Monitor this and act on it. Doing so will help to continually improve the service for your users. Many options are available for improving the overall performance of your service. The following examples are based on the 4 Ps of marketing: Taking an iterative approach to service development will increase the speed of improvements and minimises the risk of failure.

Version control allows you to track changes to code over time, which means you can: Version control also has tools for seeing what code has been changed, how it’s been changed, and who made the changes. When updating the code, make small, discrete ‘commits’ of changes and group the changes according to their intention. Any changes should be committed with a clear message explaining what changes have happened, and (where appropriate) provide links to any supporting information like development stories, bug reports, or 3rd party documentation. GDS use a distributed version control system called Git, which is one of the most well-known options.

The sample list of user stories provided is not intended to be a complete list of all areas of interest nor are you likely to need to do all of this for every service. The idea is for this list to be a good starting place from where to you can write additional stories, delete ones you do not require and split stories into smaller ones. Importantly you also need to provide your own acceptance criteria specific to the needs of your service. Remember these stories are a placeholder for a conversation. For some contexts, that conversation will be ‘this does not apply to my service’ – that is fine. But there will almost certainly be other stories not listed here which do apply. An issue we have observed on a number of projects is a lack of understanding early on in a project about the work required to run a large online service. Often this is placed under  hosting and is investigated too late in the process. The hosting of a complex and sensitive software application requires a team of people with specialist skills to design, setup and operate. Because this work is generally not user facing and can be highly technical it is sometimes easy to leave until later – with potentially dire consequences for launching safely and on time. Does your team have people who deeply understand this topic? If you are not an expert then it is important to involve people permanently in the team who are. They can explain the technical trade offs and decisions which may affect your service. As well as understanding the potentially large scope of work, many of the areas discussed here have lead times associated with third parties. The earlier stories related to these topics are brought into project backlogs the sooner estimates can be made and deadlines understood. The following stories are intended to provide a starting point for any project, rather than be a complete set. Individual projects would be expected to take and modify stories as needed and importantly to apply their own acceptance criteria specific to their requirements. The majority of these stories are from the point of view of developers, web operations engineers and the responsible service manager. Although not ideal, for this particular technical topic this works reasonably well. Feel free to change the focus when using them in your backlog.

It won’t stop you from using existing skills and knowledge, but it will require your team, users and stakeholders to start working together in new ways.  Prioritise features for users over everyone else – including your big, scary stakeholders – and ask for their feedback early and often. Really listen to your users. Even when they tell you things you don’t want to hear or disagree with. If possible, use data from real people that are using your product and let it influence the direction of your project. Constantly put users first.  Iterate often. Build something that strives to achieve the most valuable user need and show it to the users, listen to their feedback and improve it. Keep doing this until you have something so useful that they wouldn’t be without it. It might sound like over-simplifying the complexity of software development and project management, but agile development is all about “what do you want by next Friday?” The process of producing incremental, production-ready software allows your team to: Run a retrospective at the end of each delivery cycle or sprint to review what worked or what could be improved. Your team will continue to learn through delivery cycles and improve throughout the project.  Small teams of between 5 to 10 people are often more productive and predictable than larger teams. Forget man-days (the amount of work produced by an average worker in a day) and think about your team as a unit. A good team includes members with all of the skills necessary to successfully produce software.

Learn to fail, and create a culture that learns from failure.  It’s a myth that you don’t plan on agile projects.  The freedom of agile projects does not come free: you have to plan. You just plan differently and continuously. Base your agile planning on solid, historical data, not theories or opinions. Your plan must continuously demonstrate its accuracy: nobody on your agile project should take it for granted that the plan is workable. Your teams should plan together, on at least 2 levels: Review these plans after every sprint and adjust them based on:  If your team is new to agile, be wary of familiar situations and reactions from having to do things differently.

It’s the best way for people who govern to see progress because you get to look at or use what’s being developed by the team and form your own view of how they’re meeting user needs. You’ll also leave the show and tell with information to share with the wider organisation afterwards. Even early in the development of a service (in the discovery and alpha phases), there are many things that the team can do to demonstrate the outcomes of their work. This gives you the chance to offer feedback to help shape what the team does next.  The delivery team runs the show and tell, but you can ask for specific things to be shown. It’s the team’s responsibility to make sure the meeting is useful to the people there. You should check with them beforehand to understand what will be expected of you. The show and tell is an opportunity for you to ask questions about the work done and provide feedback. It’s not an opportunity to argue for changes in the team’s plans or challenge their user research - if you have concerns around these, take them up with the service manager before the meeting. Check with the team before inviting others. If a larger group wants to see progress, you should organise a separate presentation-style meeting. The team will highlight issues, dependencies, assumptions and risks that are affecting them but the meeting isn’t a forum for detailed review or discussion of these. You should be prepared to make decisions that unblock the team and tell them how you’re dealing with dependencies and risks outside their control. If you can’t unblock them immediately you should work with them to do so as quickly as possible to avoid slowing down delivery.

Adding more people, particularly when done quickly, is likely to magnify any problems if the team isn’t working well. Your team should tell you when it thinks scaling up is a good option. You may need to scale up if: there’s too much work for the team your current pace means you won’t meet delivery commitments the team is too big or too far apart to work together effectively This might be the case if: the backlog isn’t reducing in size despite steady progress you’re finding it difficult to prioritise, plan and manage dependencies between things the team’s delivery manager has too much work Where there are obvious pieces of work in the backlog that would sustain another team it can make sense to scale up and split the backlog into themes for multiple teams to work on in parallel. Before scaling up, check that the backlog is really as big as you think — is everything in it necessary by a fixed date? Delivery teams should track their progress to forecast when they will complete work. If forecasts show that delivery will happen after a deadline, you may be able to scale up to meet your delivery date. As a team grows, it may become too big to work as effectively as 2 smaller teams would. This can have a negative impact on the culture and behaviours of people working in the team — so it could be better to split into smaller teams. Your team might be too big if: the daily stand-up is lasting more than 15 minutes team members’ updates are not relevant to everyone you start to see smaller stand-ups happening organically after the main stand-up so people who are working together can plan better  It might also make sense to split a big team when different features of your service require different balances of skills to develop. Teams working on particular features should remain multidisciplinary. Having smaller teams in this situation simplifies communication. Adding more people will slow delivery initially. Be prepared for a drop in productivity while new people are brought up to speed and integrated into the team. If you add too many people, it could eventually lead to a permanent slowing down of the team due to communication and coordination overheads. When scaling up there’s also a risk that you could lose your delivery focused culture. Try to ‘seed’ new teams with existing team members to provide continuity in culture, knowledge and expertise. Seed new teams with existing team members  Only add more people when you are confident that they are a good cultural fit and have the right skills and experience. Don’t attempt to make do - if you can’t get the right people available to work on the service, adjust your scope or delivery deadlines instead.

Those working in creative and technical fields often need plenty of space for focused, detailed work. It’s not uncommon to see people spending a significant chunk of their day with headphones on to help them focus, or locked in conversation with just one person with whom they’re pairing. Equally, you might expect to see lots of short meetings throughout a day, often around walls covered in notes or reference material. These regular exchanges are important to ensure the quality of the work, but can seem strange in office cultures that are much more used to formal meetings or conference calls. The room a team works in is a tool. It is just as important as the choice of project management tools or choice of programming language. Teams should dedicate time at the beginning of a project to making sure they have everything they need and addressing any problems. This might include setting up a project wall, configuring collaboration software like email groups or project trackers, building and installing dashboards, putting up whiteboards, or simply moving desks about so the team can sit together. Removing those dividers between desks makes a big difference and allows conversation between the team to flow more freely. If large monitors are getting in the way remove them. You might also want to think about getting desk tidies like these. The difference a tidy environment makes to ability of a team to think and work is striking. This process is known as ‘hacking the environment’. This might seem like an obvious one, but teams working together to deliver a product should sit close together. Short, informal conversations are an important way to test assumptions, and this gets much harder when a team is distributed across an office, or worse, in different buildings. When working on the design, development and operation of a service it’s essential that your team be able to be in constant contact with one another to make rapid decisions, provide support and information and to ensure everyone’s aware of the project as a whole. Some of that will be achieved through regular short meetings such as a daily standup or weekly ‘show and tell’ session, but there’s also a need for an asynchronous mechanism that’s more immediate and conversational than email but that allows people to dip in and out. Internet Relay Chat (IRC) – and similar tools such as group messengers, Campfire, and so on – operate as software running on the user’s computer as a dedicated application or in a web browser, supporting a constant stream of live conversation. Typically, a user would leave the service running in the background while working on other things, switching focus when a break is needed or when you need to ask a specific question. Questions might be along the lines of: Anyone on the team would be able to respond with information, suggestions of other people to talk to, and so on. Because it is network based it will also work regardless of geography so distributed teams can continue to communicate as if they were in one room.

Prototyping is an essential process to get a feel for the shape and edges of a product, to begin to estimate the work involved and to provide something you can quickly test with real users. This is a vital part of a process often known as ‘product discovery’: We built alpha.gov.uk as a prototype of what would later become the single domain www.gov.uk. It was built quickly without much concern to scalability, resilience, or any of the other considerations of a ‘real’ product, because none of those matter unless the core concept is sound. That allowed us to get feedback early and also understand some of the trickier concepts we would have to grapple with, like the fuzzy lines between different audiences, the operational processes that would be required, and so on. Prototyping can start on paper with sketches. Hand-drawn sketches of what a service might involve are a good way to begin thinking things through. We encourage everyone to get to running code as quickly as possible. It’s only when you start working in the same medium your users will be using (for online services that’s generally a web browser, but it may also be via an API (application programming interface)) that you can really understand the experience you need to provide. The smart answer format for GOV.UK began as a series of paper sketches refined over a week by a small team. That process gave them a good sense of the boundaries of the problem they were trying to solve. As quickly as possible we prototyped the format using HTML and JavaScript so that it could be experienced in a web browser. That revealed more constraints, such as the fact that users might expect to be able to go back and amend an answer without realising that would change their whole journey through the format. This allowed us to quickly adjust the user interface to be clearer for its users before we started the work of building out the full system. Running code also forces you to think about your integrations with other services and how they might work – do you need to send email? integrate with an existing database? and so on. A prototype will rarely actually include these integrations but having a clear picture of them is vital if you’re going to understand the real effort involved in building and operating the service.","description":"The best way to understand a product is to try to build it.

GDS can give you advice on buying this sort of capability through existing processes like G-Cloud, Spot-buy etc. You can now use the Digital Marketplace. An underlying principle behind Agile development is that people are more important than process. It has been proven that great teams make great products whether they’re in government or business. At GDS, we don’t call people ‘resources’, whether permanent or contract. You look after people, resources are things you use (and discard). Some guiding principles for service managers or delivery managers: And don’t forget, contractors can’t sign things. Suppliers and permanent staff should sit together, work together and work through problems together. The team should create an environment where difficult questions can be asked and all ideas are listened to. All team members should work to do the right thing for the user, not just what they have been asked to do. Both suppliers and permanent staff should suggest ideas and work together to identify further skills gaps and solutions to create a better product. The individual’s or company’s intention should always be to disengage from the department, leaving the team to function on its own. Your team structure and processes should centre around transferring knowledge to permanent staff, wherever possible. Don’t let a contractor become a single point of failure and treat all team members (permanent and contractors) the same.

Free chapter on “Writing User Stories” available at http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/books/user-stories-applied A user story briefly explains: User stories are an essential part of the agile toolkit. They’re a way of organising your work into manageable chunks that create tangible value, and can be discussed and prioritised independently. User stories are a technique which relies on other agile practices, including continuous delivery, and face-to-face communication with user representatives. It’s not sufficient to simply ‘set’ a user representative: that user representative needs to be in the same place as the team and available to the team a sufficient amount of time. User stories can be added to a product backlog at any point in the sprint cycle by any person in the team. It’s up to the product owner to coordinate and prioritise them, and to select stories for each sprint at the start of each sprint cycle. Discuss the stories ahead of sprint planning with:  A user story is represented through a story card that has a title and a few lines of text. Your story cards can be virtual, as well as actual cards. On a large product/service keep your stories in a digital format, and then turn them into physical cards as part of sprint planning. When writing a user story, make sure the story is well-formed. Don’t skip the part explaining why there’s a need for a service just because it can be difficult. You might want to include a list of acceptance criteria. These should be a reminder for things to test or check which may have come up during conversation, but they should not be used as a way of defining the scope of a story. If stories are too big then split them into smaller stories as they stand more chance of producing shippable (ready to use) code. Story cards follow a standard structure: They don’t capture every detail, but you should have a more in-depth discussion about a user story at the appropriate time. Building useful software systems is hard, so you need to make sure you’re solving the right problem. Agile methodologies emphasise an outside-in approach – what outcome is your service user trying to achieve? If you dive into the solution without a good understanding of your users, you risk solving the wrong problem, or coming up with solutions which don’t really work for your users in the real world. That’s why the most important part of a user story is the goal. Use this to help you decide whether the story is “done” or delivered, ie does the work meet the goal of the user? When writing stories with your development team, always start by thinking about and discussing your users’ goals: Suzanne and James Robertson have excellent advice on this in the book Mastering the Requirements Process (3rd edition). Being specific about the actor will help you to break down interactions into logical chunks. Sometimes the actor will be a user of your service, or the actor will be an administrator, technician or manager in your organisation. Make sure you already have a good understanding of your users from your initial project work or existing research. If not, take the time to develop that understanding. Use this as a reminder of the main interaction that needs to be addressed as part of the user experience. Remember that the story card does not need to spell out every detail.  Agile teams prefer face-to-face conversation over detailed documentation. Face-to-face is: The story card is just a placeholder, a promise to have a conversation when the time is right. Use the story card and some brief initial conversations to estimate the amount of time a story needs to be completed and then put it into an agile backlog. When development work actually starts, consult the users or user representative to fill out the story details. A user story is the sum of all of these conversations, sketches and whiteboard diagrams – not just the card. You don’t need to write down or archive your conversations, but translate them directly into automated tests and working code. Using user stories in this way allows you to avoid ‘analysis paralysis’, the painful condition of trying to guess the details of some far-future goal. Acceptance criteria can be used to determine when a story is done. These follow a conversation between developer and user or user representative and are considered before coding begins. Only include these on the back of the story card if the team finds them useful for recording user assumptions they might later forget. Sometimes writing acceptance criteria on the story card is useful where the user or user representative is not immediately available but is no substitute at all for face-to-face conversation. The success of a user story is dependent on regular face-to-face communication between developers and users or user representatives.
