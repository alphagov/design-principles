        <h1>The voice of GOV.UK</h1>
        <div class="outline">
          <p>We speak to the user in their language. We give them the information they want to know and we make sure they find it quickly.  </p>
       </div>
        <p> Our writing is:

        <li>serious but not pompous</li>
        <li>in the vernacular ;-)</li>
        <li>active and engaging</li>
        <li>trustworthy and official</li>
        <li>definitive and authoratitive</li>
        <li>incisive (but still human)</li>
        <li>brief, succinct and to the point</li>
        </p>
       
        <h1>Title</h1>
        <div class="outline">
          <p>We get straight to the point, and then we stay there.</p>

          <p>Our ethos to write concisely and tell people what they need to know or need to do, and not what government thinks they might want to know. We don't confound people with extra information, however useful we might think that is.

          You won't find government jargon or complex, unwieldy sentences on GOV.UK. Obviously we write in plain English. We don't let caveats (including grammatical ones) cloud simplicity, eg we say "you can" and not "you may be able to".

        <h1>Content design</h1>
        <div class="outline">
          <p>We analysed our content needs and found we needed a suite of content formats. These different formats allow us to effectively answer user needs by designing content that's clear, rummageable and gives people confidence that they've got the right answer.</p>
       </div>
        <h2>Guides</h2>
          <p>Our guides are a set of related information about a specific topic (eg example) or life event (eg After someone dies). One guide has one or more related 'parts' - people can see the edges of a topic and choose to read the length and breadth or it or simply go straight to a specific section.</p>
          
        <h2>Answers</h2>
        <p>Our answers assume prior knowledge of a subject and answer one specific need, eg "What is the National Minimum wage rate?" We answer the question only and give the rate. We don't crowd the answer with surplus information. We also use answers to address popular needs (eg passport fees). We go into detail on [example] in a guide about the subject.</p>
      
        <h2>Benefits and schemes</h2>
        <p>A swathe of content is about money and other things you can get from government. Among the morass of information about these schemes, the user needs are centred around 3 tasks: How much can I get? Am I eligible? How do I claim? Our 'Benefits and schemes' format allows us to design content around these tasks.

        <h2>Services</h2>
        <p>What can we say about this format, other than it lets us direct people to 'find the quick do'!
