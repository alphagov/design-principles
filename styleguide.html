        <h1>The voice of GOV.UK</h1>
        <div class="outline">
          <p>We speak to the user in their language. We give them the information they want to know and we make sure they find it quickly.  </p>
        </div>
        <p> Our writing is:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>serious but not pompous</li>
          <li>in the vernacular ;-)</li>
          <li>active and engaging</li>
          <li>trustworthy and official</li>
          <li>definitive and authoratitive</li>
          <li>incisive (but still human)</li>
          <li>brief, succinct and to the point</li>
        </ul>
      </article>

        <h1>Do not pass Go</h1>
        <div class="outline">
          <p>We get straight to the point, and then we stay there.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Our ethos is to write concisely and tell people what they need to know or need to do, and not what government thinks they might want to know. We don't confound people with extra information, however useful we might think that is.</p>
        <p>You won't find government jargon or complex, unwieldy sentences on GOV.UK. Obviously we write in plain English. We don't let caveats (including grammatical ones) cloud simplicity, eg we say "you can" and not "you may be able to".</p>

        <h1>Getting rid of advice</h1>
        <div class="outline">
          <p>Analysis showed people didn't want advice from GOV.UK. We listened and obeyed.</p>
        </div>
        <p>We found no user demand for content like keeping warm in winter. But there is a place for government funded energy saving schemes, eg <a href "https://www.gov.uk/warm-front-scheme"> Warm Front.</a></p>
        <p>If there's no action for government (or the user) then we don't cover it on GOV.UK. Adviced-based content (eg how to write a CV) is done very well by other trusted organisations.</p>

        <h1>Content design</h1>
        <div class="outline">
          <p>Our analysis of our content needs spawned a suite of content formats. These allow us to effectively answer user needs by designing content that's clear and rummageable and gives people confidence that they've got the right answer.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Guides</h2>  
        <p>Our guides are a set of related information about a specific topic (eg <a href "https://www.gov.uk/council-housing"> Council housing</a>) or life event (eg <a href "https://www.gov.uk/after-a-death"> After someone dies</a>). One guide has one or more related 'parts' - people can see the edges of a topic and choose to read the whole lot or simply home in on a specific element.</p>
        <h2>Answers</h2>
        <p>Our answers assume prior knowledge of a subject and answer one specific need, eg <a href "National Minimum wage rates."></a> We answer the question only and don't crowd the answer with surplus information. We also use answers to address popular needs (eg <a href "Child Benefit rates"></a>). We go into <a href "https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit">detail on Child Benefit</a> in our guide.</p>
        <h2>Benefits and schemes</h2>
        <p>A swathe of our content is about money and other things you can get from government. Amongst the morass of information about these schemes, the user needs are always centred around 3 tasks: How much can I get? Am I eligible? How do I claim? Our 'Benefits and schemes' format allows us to design content around these tasks.</p>
        <h2>Services</h2>
        <p>What can we say about this format, other than it lets us direct people to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/file-your-self-assessment-tax-return">find the quick do!</a></p>

        <h1>Technical style points</h1>
        <p>We do what you'd expect with numerals, days of the week and link text. We use a small 'g' for government. Broadly we follow the <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/johnson/2011/07/housekeeping-announcement"> Economist Style Guide.</a></p>
